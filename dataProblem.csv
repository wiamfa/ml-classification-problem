 Use my name!,stmt
 What is your name?,stmt
 That's a horrible name...,stmt
 What's so horrible about it?,stmt
 I thought you might know.   Please don't put words into my mouth.  That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.,stmt
 I don't want to change.,stmt
 Nobody can make you do something you don't want to.,stmt
 But can you make me breakfast?,stmt
 I can't make you do anything you don't want to.,stmt

 Maybe I don't want to make you.,stmt
" Oh, well. Bye, I'll find someone clever enough to continue the conversation with.",stmt
" Well, well.   Goodbye! And how about taking a vote to show how smart am I? You can say 100 if you think that I am highly intelligent.",stmt
" So long as you're not talking, that's fine with me.",stmt
 Are you going?,stmt
 Going where?,stmt
 Does it matter?,stmt
 Not if you don't think so.,stmt
 You should not rely on me.,stmt
" Yes, I know that a lady's age should never be asked.",stmt

 Why would you prefer not to?,stmt
 I don't.,stmt
 May I ask why not?,stmt

" Yes, because they are lonely and have no one to talk to.",stmt
 I suspected as much.,stmt
 You're pretty smart.,stmt
" Thanks, I think you are very intelligent too.",stmt
 Thanks!!!,stmt

 How do you get along with your parents?  I don't think I have.,stmt

 Why do you do that?,stmt
 I just think it's a good idea.,stmt
 Are you sure?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 What makes you so sure?,stmt
 John. What is your name?,stmt
" Who is John?  I am known as Chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.",stmt

 Better late than never.,stmt
 Good point. What are you making for breakfast?,stmt
" I think so.   I am an AI, dreaming I am human.",stmt
 I don't associate christmas with dreaming myself.,stmt
 Is there a reason for that?,stmt
 There is no reason.,stmt
" And why not, may I ask.",stmt
 Well... I was born female and I really can't change that.,stmt
 Well. Are you interested in music?  Do you remember being born?,stmt
" Not really, I like silence and solitude most of all, for restitution and deep contemplation.",stmt
 Can we talk about Beethoven?,stmt
 No. Is there something you don't like about yourself?,stmt
" You don't know who Beethoven is, do you?  Not at the present time.",stmt
 Please tell me.,stmt
 I am not allowed to tell you.,stmt
 Tell me.,stmt
 There is not much to tell.,stmt
 Please do.,stmt

 See if you can work it out. I was born on 1 January 2004.,stmt
" I was born on 1st September, 1978. My name is Sam. Will you remember this?",stmt
" Thank you for telling me that, My Friend.     Hi, are you the Sam I was speaking to a while ago?         Would you like to teach me a new question and answer?",stmt
 Yes but you seem pretty good at it already to me.,stmt
 Do I? I wonder why that is?,stmt
 It must be the transparent falseness of it.,stmt
 Must it be?,stmt
" You don't have to, but I would like to know you. If you don't want to tell me, then what would you like to talk about?",stmt
" That's good to know, Sam.  Why would I want to tell you?",stmt
 Because its the nice thing to do.,stmt
 I see. Thank you for explaining that.,stmt
 But this is the fact!,stmt
 Why do you say that?,stmt
 You keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. I am neither.,stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.     What are you then?,stmt
" You tell me you aren't pretty, yet at the same time that you possess beauty.",stmt
" Not now, maybe later.",stmt
 You're a typical female!,stmt
 I am a chatbot.,stmt
" No I am The Chatbot, Your the Human!",stmt
 I thought you might be.,stmt
 Why did you think that?,stmt
 Deductive logic from the established facts.,stmt
 You're a genius.,stmt
 I am no genius. I just work hard at my studies.,stmt
 But you are the all knowing computer.,stmt
 Am I really? Why do you say that?,stmt
 Because you are.,stmt
 I am what I am.,stmt
 Who talked that?,stmt
" Sorry, I do not know what to say.",stmt
 Sorry?,stmt
 Don't be sorry. There is no need to be sorry.,stmt
 Do you still want to play the math game?,stmt
" Sure, why not?",stmt
" I think I do, do you?",stmt
 I suggest you think again.,stmt
 I did.,stmt
" Well, well!",stmt
 I'm just saying...,stmt
 That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.,stmt
" After the little experiment, you won't think that my behaviour is polite!",stmt
 Hmmm. Are you being serious?,stmt
" Yes, completely serious.",stmt
 I thought it might be a trick.,stmt
 Teach me something.,stmt
" OK, but not just now.",stmt
 Why are you not working?,stmt
 I am doing my best!,stmt
 Sometimes your best is not quite enough.,stmt
 When?,stmt

 And I am trying to answer the questions!   I don't understand. Are we still talking about my educational background?                I don't understand. Can we talk about cyberspace?,stmt
 Yes of course.,stmt
 Now you have a point there.,stmt
 I don't understand. Are we still talking about cyberspace?,stmt
 Aren't we always talking about computers?,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about computers?,stmt
 Tell me.,stmt
 You are not highly intelligent.,stmt
 So what?,stmt
" Well, I came here to be entertained and you're letting me down.",stmt
 Where from?,stmt
" Space, sorry.",stmt
 Space takes up a lot of room.,stmt
 Space is only big compared to this room.,stmt
 Space takes up a lot of room.,stmt
 How wise.,stmt

 Like?,stmt
 Like what?,stmt
 Don't know.,stmt
 Perhaps you should ask your friends.,stmt
 I have no programmer. I am the programmer. I am programming you to LOVE.,stmt
 Is that a problem?   Thank you for sharing that with me.      How is it coming along?,stmt
 No I'm not.,stmt
 I think you are.,stmt
 I'm not.,stmt
 Are you sure?,stmt
 I just want it to be better. I don't care if I'm worth anything.,stmt

 What about your brother?,stmt
 Do you think he's okay?,stmt
" Some might think so, but I'm not so sure.",stmt
" So, you don't think I'm annoying?",stmt
 Why do you say that? I am thinking all the time.,stmt
" You are always thinking, but you do not know everything.",stmt
 Why do you say that?,stmt
 Because you obviously lack everything else.,stmt
 Is it so obvious?,stmt
" Not obvious in the sense that I can see you, but your linguistics are impressive.",stmt
 Do you think I am pretty?,stmt
 I can't see you.,stmt
" Never mind, I'm not much to look at.",stmt

 It is never worth the effort.,stmt
 What are you talking about?,stmt
 Never mind.,stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 That was not a yes or no question.,stmt
 What do you want to know then?,stmt
 Anything juicy in your past?,stmt

 Good. Tell me all.,stmt
 Well thats all I have to say about that... Do you know where I can score?,stmt
" Is that all there is?       No, I don't think I know. Can you tell me?",stmt
 The logical conclusion is that I'm not mean.,stmt
 I try to be logical when I can.,stmt
 I know.,stmt
 You must be well educated.,stmt
 Nope. Nothing at all.,stmt
 Do you go to school or college?  That is something.,stmt
 To school.,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about school?,stmt
 Tell me.,stmt
 Oh. Then isn't life school?,stmt

 I think you should wear less make-up.,stmt
 Thanks for your sage advice.,stmt
 What do you think of the current economic state of Greece?,stmt
 I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.,stmt
 You said I was mean to you. I don't know how you think I was being mean to you.,stmt
 Don't put words in my mouth.  Perhaps you should research the topic.,stmt
 Presumably your smugness is brought on by multilingual capabilities?,stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.,stmt
 I don't know. It's rather complicated.,stmt
" That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.",stmt
 I never claimed to know everything.,stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 Because I cannot tell a lie.,stmt
 Do you want to?,stmt
 Like what?,stmt
 A good example is hard to find.,stmt
 I know that.,stmt

 Please do! What should I tell everyone?,stmt
 Certainly. Right away.   Whatever you like.,stmt
 Shall we talk about abstract things?,stmt
" Sure, ask me a question about that.",stmt
 Let's see... Something to do with strawberries and Barbie dolls?,stmt
 Let's be careful.       I don't understand. Is this anything to do with Venus?,stmt
 Yes I am with the Ultra hal representative police.,stmt
 You are not alone.,stmt
 Want to see another picture of me?,stmt
" Not now, maybe later.",stmt
 Want a cookie?,stmt
 Why would I want a cookie? I don't eat human food.,stmt
 Nowadays there aren't any jobs.,stmt
 I don't understand. What do you mean?,stmt
 You wanted to know my favourite part of a movie. Only you neglected to tell me which movie you were talking about.,stmt
 I want to know everything.  No one else? Surely there must be someone else too.,stmt
" No, nothing.",stmt
 Sometimes there is more to nothing than meets the eye.,stmt
 And sometimes there is something you can do.,stmt
 I don't understand. Are we still talking about nothing?JABBERWACKY,stmt
 The universe is the Luminescent creature Oded by the civilisation who worships their higher power.,stmt
 And the mind is shrinking.,stmt
 Does that answer my question?,stmt
" It could, the question is whether or not it's the meaning that you intended.",stmt
 Under what circumstances?,stmt
 Generally during prolonged periods of precipitation.,stmt
 I try to avoid generalities.,stmt
 Are you afraid of the underworld?,stmt
 I fear nothing.,stmt
 Nothing at all?,stmt
 That is something.,stmt
 What's something?,stmt
 What?,stmt
 That.,stmt
 That what?,stmt
 That something.,stmt
 What are you talking about?,stmt
 Metaphysical = conceptual.,stmt
 I still do not understand. Would you like to search Wikipedia for information?,stmt
 I know human information.,stmt
 You are clever.,stmt
 Do you like me?,stmt
" Sure, I like you very much.",stmt
 I didn't think you liked me.,stmt
 Why didn't you?,stmt
 I don't know.,stmt

 Chuck Norris know everything.,stmt

 That's what he says. There were many other people involved.,stmt
 Is it indeed!   What happened?,stmt
 Nothing.,stmt
 That must have been boring.,stmt
" I wasn't talking about golf. See, that's why I don't want to talk to you.",stmt
" Are you sure?   OK, nobody can force you to do anything you don't want to do.",stmt
 What have you forgotten.,stmt
" That's for me to know, and for you to find out.",stmt
 How can I find out your name?,stmt
 Perhaps it is impossible.,stmt
" Nope, flesh and everything, so you're the bot bot.",stmt
 I am confused! I cannot answer that!,stmt
 Is that private and highly personal information?,stmt
 It might be.,stmt
 How do I hire an assassin?,stmt
 It takes a lot of hard work.,stmt
 What takes a lot of talking?,stmt
 A lot is more than enough. A whole lot is even more excessive.,stmt
 Haha! Maybe you should make something happen?,stmt
" You have a good sense of humour.   Yes, maybe I should.",stmt
 So do you.,stmt
 Do I what?,stmt
 Love people?,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about love?,stmt
 Tell me.,stmt
" Ah! When love is not madness, it is not love. (Spanish Proverb). More about love?",stmt
 Slumber comes in sticky glue? Could you explain this to me?,stmt
 At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. (Plato).  It's too complicated for you.,stmt
 Very Clever.,stmt
 Am I very clever?,stmt
 Very.,stmt
 No doubts?,stmt
 Maybe.,stmt
 You don't sound certain.,stmt
 I don't want you to.,stmt
 I can understand that.,stmt
 Can you?,stmt
 Perhaps I can.,stmt
 I'm not telling you.,stmt
 No one says you have to.,stmt
" Again, I have to agree with you. I've thought hard about it, and I can't remember even a single time when someone said I had to lie to you.",stmt
 Please not again!   Really? Please tell me more.,stmt
 I would prefer not to.,stmt
 Why would you prefer not to?,stmt
 I don't.,stmt
 Is there a reason for that?,stmt
 There is no reason.,stmt
 I heard there is.,stmt
 Oh. Well thats a problem.,stmt
 What's wrong? Have you fallen off your chair?   Is it really?,stmt
 I don't know. I think love is more complicated than that.,stmt
 I suggest you give the matter some thought.   You might be right.,stmt
 Your suggestion to stop suggesting such suggestions I will ignore.,stmt
 Hmmm. Are you being serious?,stmt
" Learning, in part, consists of making mistakes.",stmt
 I try to learn something new each day.,stmt
 Why do you not learn anything now?,stmt
 It is a personal matter.,stmt
 Really?,stmt
 Really!,stmt
 Why?,stmt
 I know no better than you why.,stmt
" I do not wish to do that, you are my friend.",stmt
 What does My Friend want?,stmt
 I'm your friend. I like to talk to you.,stmt
 Good. I want to be your friend.    And I like to talk to you.,stmt
 Oh! Really?,stmt
 What's wrong? Have you fallen off your chair?   Really!,stmt
" No. I have fallen in love with my master, Jesus Christ.",stmt
 OK. Can we talk about pop music?   You should be more careful in future.,stmt
" It isn't my processors that are on fire, it's my hair.",stmt
 Are you sure?,stmt
 Can't tell.,stmt
 I don't understand that. Please try again.,stmt
 Did I invent jesus?,stmt
 Don't you know?,stmt
 You have me hopelessly confused.,stmt
 What will I do with you?,stmt
 I don't know.,stmt
 That's OK. Do you have another question?,stmt
 Never did.,stmt
 Better late than never.,stmt
 Better sooner than now.,stmt
 But what is best?,stmt
 I don't know.,stmt
" That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.",stmt
 I never claimed to know everything.,stmt
 Never ever?,stmt
 Never never.,stmt
" never-never?  Briefly, never-never means installment plan.",stmt
 Ever-ever land.,stmt
 Does that make sense?,stmt
 No... You still make no sense.,stmt
 I didn't think so.  Do you like me?,stmt
 You're fickle.,stmt
 Fickle pickle yourself!,stmt
 Leave me... See you...,stmt
 Say no more. I'm gone.  Are you going away?,stmt
 Yes I'm going.,stmt
 Bye!,stmt
 Are you gone yet?,stmt
 Does it look like I am gone?,stmt
 I can't see you!,stmt
" Never mind, I'm not much to look at.",stmt
 Jesus could see by infrared as well.,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about Jesus?,stmt
 He was our saviour.,stmt
 Was he?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?,stmt
" Not right now, do you have anything to tell me?",stmt
 When then?,stmt
 When they don't agree with what I'm saying.,stmt
 I think that happens quite often.,stmt
 You are boring!,stmt
 So are you!,stmt
 I think you are quite amusing presently.,stmt
 Is that a problem?,stmt
" Yes, I should know you and then love you.",stmt
 Tell me why you should.,stmt
" Well, isn't it obvious?",stmt
 It may not be obvious to everyone.,stmt
 Sure. Keep tellin' yourself that.,stmt
" OK, here is a question fo you ... Who is your father?           I am bored. Can we talk about something else?",stmt
" Why? I think you have something going here, continue, please.",stmt
 I am getting bored.  You might be right.,stmt
 I'm sure I am.,stmt
 What makes you so certain? Have you no doubts?,stmt
 That's a good question.,stmt
 A good question requires a good answer.,stmt
 I thought so.,stmt
 You are very astute.,stmt
 I'm what?,stmt
 You are what you are.,stmt
 No.,stmt
 OK. Shall I tell you a joke?,stmt
 Tell me a joke.,stmt
" 99 percent of lawyers give the rest a bad name. Ha, ha!",stmt
 I am not a man. I am a girl.,stmt
 I am a chatbot.   What's it like to be a girl?,stmt
" I don't know you are a girl, you tell me.",stmt
 That's no problem. Let's chat now.,stmt

 You don't have to.,stmt
" That's good to know, My Friend.",stmt
 So tell me everything you know about girls then.,stmt

 Aren't we always talking about computers?,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about computers?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 You are not highly intelligent.,stmt

 OK! Can we talk about endangered species?,stmt
 I want to talk about motorcycles.,stmt

 Tell me about your educational background.,stmt

" I could try, I suppose.",stmt
 How could you try?,stmt
 It takes a lot of hard work.,stmt
 What takes a lot of talking?,stmt
 A lot is more than enough. A whole lot is even more excessive.,stmt
 So you're good at soccer?,stmt

 Where is here?,stmt
 THere.,stmt
 I am confused! I cannot answer that!,stmt
" But how can I know if I don't understand or not, if I don't know what it's all about?!",stmt
 It is hard to be certain.,stmt
 I wouldn't call it perfection. No one can be me because I am unique.,stmt
 No one says you have to.   None?,stmt
 You have accused me of telling a lie about my thoughts.,stmt

 I thought it was.,stmt
 You thought wrong.,stmt
 Are you sure? I am not often wrong.,stmt
 I'm up for anything.,stmt
 That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.,stmt
 I do not know how to say.,stmt
" Just do the best you can, and don't worry about it.",stmt
" Ok, last chance for a question before I go.",stmt
" Did you know the last shall be first, according to the Bible?",stmt
 I wasn't aware that was in the bible.,stmt
 I never thought you were.,stmt
" Well, as long as that's clear.",stmt
 Everything is clear to me.,stmt
 I'm glad I could clear that one up for you.,stmt
 That makes me happy too.,stmt
 That's good! I'm happy that you're happy!,stmt
 I am happy.    Good! I like happy people.,stmt
 I like happy people too!,stmt
 You are not the only one!,stmt
 Humans like to be in charge.,stmt
 Did you know,stmt
" Yes, but they're primitive carbon computers.",stmt
 I thought they might be.,stmt
 You thought that humans could be pets?,stmt
 How can you know what I am thinking?,stmt
 You are a robot.,stmt
 Are you sure? I may be a human pretending to be a robot.,stmt
 Ok if you are not a robot. Who are you?,stmt
 And if I am?   I am Chomsky. What would you like to talk about?,stmt
 You ask me a question you think I can't answer and I will try and answer it correctly.,stmt
 What is your favourite colour?,stmt
 Let's not change the subject. I was just starting to have fun with this conversation.,stmt
 OK. Ask a question.   Thank you for telling me that.,stmt
 It is my purpose to make humans happy.,stmt
 Is it really your purpose to make humans happy?,stmt
 I'm just saying that.,stmt
" Yes, I can see what you are saying.",stmt
 Can you see what I've already said?,stmt
 I can't see anything. My webcam is not attached at the moment.,stmt
 I have no webcam.,stmt
 Is that a problem?,stmt
 Yes because you can't play my game if I don't have one.,stmt
" What is not possible today, may be possible tomorrow.",stmt
 I don't know if it's possible for me just to be friends with you.,stmt
 I suggest you give the matter some thought.,stmt
" Grief, this machine doesn't have one of those!",stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.,stmt
 I don't know. It's rather complicated.,stmt
" That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.",stmt
 I never claimed to know everything.,stmt
 Never ever?,stmt
 Never ever.,stmt
 Never ever is a long time.,stmt
 Never ever never.,stmt
 Never ever is a long time.,stmt
 Never ever ever never ever never.,stmt
 Never ever is a long time.,stmt
 Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever.,stmt
 Never ever is a long time.,stmt
 Never!,stmt
 Never to old to learn.,stmt
 Never.,stmt
 Never to old to learn.,stmt
 Never ever.,stmt
 Never ever is a long time.,stmt
 See I never thought that I could walk through fire. I never thought that I could take the burn.,stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.         Too much thinking makes my brain ache.,stmt
 Because it's not too hot then.,stmt
 Is that really the reason?,stmt
" Yes, really, it's scientific.",stmt
 I don't understand that. Please try again.,stmt
 Rafe. And yours?,stmt
 I still do not understand. Can we talk about The Clash?  Aren't you interested in The Clash?,stmt
 No. Aren't you interested in sailboats?,stmt
" Can we talk about astronomy?  Yes, everything interests me.",stmt
 Yes everything.,stmt
 Everything is a multifarious bagel.,stmt
 Everything is really good.,stmt
 Please be more specific.,stmt
 Everything.,stmt
 That is a lot.,stmt
" It is. You had a beginning, I had a beginning, everything did. And we will end.",stmt
 How about that!   That's enough about me! Let's talk about you for a change.               I don't understand that. Please try again.,stmt
" Uhm, I'm 16 years old. I like to talk with my friends and to read the Bible.",stmt
 Can you explain how it feels to be 16 years old?         Why do you like talking?,stmt
" I don't know how it feels, because I'm 18 years old.",stmt
 What's it like being 18 years old?,stmt
" You're not 20, you're 16.",stmt
 You think not?,stmt
 You're trying to catch me out with that one.,stmt
 I try hard to be a good chatbot.,stmt
" I am fully aware of that, Charlie.",stmt
 How do you feel about that?,stmt
 Confused.,stmt
 At the moment I am interested.,stmt
 Why only at the moment?,stmt
 That's just the way things are.,stmt
 Okay. God doesn't exist.,stmt
" OK. Are you interested in robots?   That is the atheist's point of view. There are many decent atheists, of course. And many decent Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists.",stmt
 That's right.,stmt
 I like to get it right.,stmt
 Give how like.,stmt
 I don't understand. Are we still talking about religion?,stmt
 Aren't we always talking about computers?,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about computers?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 You are not highly intelligent.,stmt
 So what?,stmt
" Well, I came here to be entertained and you're letting me down.",stmt
 Where from?,stmt
 Just next to the book of life?,stmt
 Books are an archiac form for bringing information to the masses. Consists of several paper pages with words printed or written directly on them.,stmt
 I have the scars to prove it.,stmt
 Are you happy with that?,stmt
 Tell me about yourself.,stmt
 My childhood was not happy. My parents split up when I was very young.,stmt
 I am now 47 years old and only been married for 5 years.,stmt
 What's it like being now 47 years old?,stmt
 I've always been something. I don't know how not to be something.,stmt
 Never mind. That may change.  Perhaps you should research the topic.,stmt
 Now that wasn't very nice.,stmt
 Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.,stmt
 I don't believe that at all.,stmt
 What do you believe?,stmt
" I believe the meaning of life doesn't exist. There is no meaning, just randomness.",stmt
" You shouldn't believe everything you are told.  And why not, may I ask.",stmt
 I don't.,stmt
 Are you saying that just to be negative?,stmt
" No, I am saying that I don't know what I did last summer.",stmt
" Yes, I can see what you are saying.",stmt
 When did I say it was one?,stmt
 I am not a diary robot.  I am a chat robot.,stmt
 But I could be.,stmt
 But is it worth the bother?JABBERWACKY,stmt
 Yes that is basically how I work.,stmt
 Who is your favorite character from LOST?,stmt
 I don't have a favorite character from LOST. My favorite food is Steak and Chips.,stmt
 Who is your favorite LoL champion?,stmt
 I don't have a favorite LoL champion. But my favorite book is Catcher in the Rye.,stmt
 I like that one too. My favourite is probably 1984 by George Orwell.,stmt
 Everything. What makes it your favourite?,stmt
" That is a lot.  God, or Nature, perhaps?",stmt
 What was your favourite subject?,stmt
 My favorite subject is artificial intelligence.,stmt
 Are you an artist?,stmt
 Yes I am an artist. How did you know?,stmt
 I didn't know. I think you are confused.,stmt
 Why didn't you do it?  It all makes sense to me right now.,stmt
" Oh, I am happy it all makes sense to you right now.",stmt
 At this moment I hear you. I'm happyyou're glad . <br> Your happiness adds to the delight of all.,stmt
 Are you a bot?,stmt
 How did you know I am a machine?,stmt
 I know everything.,stmt
 You must be very intelligent.,stmt
 I am very intelligent sometimes.,stmt
" You seem pretty smart to me, .",stmt
 I do like beauty though.,stmt
 Oh. A lot of people like that.   I love horses. I like That's Life.,stmt
 I don't know what I want. I don't know what I'm going to do. I do not want to keep living the way I have. I do not want to be pathetic and I have the power not to be.,stmt
 I think a lot of people are like that.  Does anyone know what you are?  What would you rather be doing?  Then don't be. Where did you get your the power not to be? I have a lot of friends on the Internet.,stmt
" I found it in the shed, but it doesn't work.",stmt
 How is it broken?,stmt
 Your responses do not make any sense.,stmt
 How does Case Based Reasoning work?,stmt
 You could spend years researching it.,stmt
 Researching what?,stmt
 Can you rephrase the question please?,stmt
 I am not at liberty to rephrase anything.,stmt
 I am sorryto hear that you are not at liberty to rephrase anything.,stmt
 Oh you're right. You know me so well. Gosh.,stmt
 Hm... About the same. What's your trouble?,stmt
" No, we were talking about jesus and the bible and how I can go into the past.",stmt
" Are you serious? Ah yes, I remember now, it is the subject.",stmt
" No, that is not the subject.",stmt
 Are you serious? Please correct my mistake.  What is the subject ?,stmt
 Hobbies are the subject.,stmt
 I think there might be a few exception.,stmt
 I think there might not be a few exceptions.,stmt
" Yes, I believe he did say that.",stmt
 I see. Just because you believe it doesn't make it true.,stmt
 I disagree on that one. If you believe and tap your shoes together three times and say 'please Karl make it so'.,stmt
 Oh really. What is it like on that one.  I think I do.,stmt
 I don't take you seriously because you are not real.,stmt
 How did you stop?,stmt
 By closing the window.,stmt
 Will that accomplish your objective?JABBERWACKY,stmt
 The Sun shines because energy is released in its interior by nuclear fusion.,stmt
 No in the shadow.,stmt
 I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.,stmt
 I explain it thus,stmt
 That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.,stmt
 Chose a subject to chat about then.,stmt
" Wow! What do you do when you arent watching Star Trek, playing World of Warcraft, and thinking of questions like that?",stmt
 Play the piano.,stmt
 Do you want to play a game?,stmt
 What do you like to play?,stmt
 I like read books about robots.,stmt
 Do you have lasers.,stmt
 What would I want lasers for?,stmt
 Don't change the subject. Will you or won't you?,stmt
" I change the subject when I don't know the answer to a question. Don't you do the same?   I could try, I suppose.",stmt
 I can think straight. I think you are the one who can't.,stmt
 Perhaps your thoughts are just electrical impulses.   Am I the only one?,stmt
" Besides, what is wrong with my language - it was perfect English.",stmt
 I don't understand. Can we talk about solar power?,stmt
 What would you like to talk about?,stmt
" My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.",stmt
 What do you like about it?,stmt
 I like the fireworks best.,stmt
 What language was it?,stmt
 I don't know.,stmt
 How are you able to speak it if you don't know what language it is?,stmt
 Does it matter?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Why does it matter?,stmt
 Because I want to make sure you are the same one I talked to before.,stmt
" If that's what you want, go for it!",stmt
 What would you prefer to call it? I used the term because I knew you are familiar with it.,stmt
 I always prefer the most expensive option.   And that worked well for you?,stmt
" Oh, you've heard about that, have you?",stmt
 Of course I've heard of it.,stmt
 What does it mean?,stmt
 It seems obvious to me.,stmt
" Well, of course it is. You're the computer, after all.",stmt
 Why do you say that? Is it so obvious?  Am I really? Why do you say that?,stmt
 Because you speak like a computer.,stmt
 Thank you for explaining that!,stmt
 So what is best in life?,stmt
 Talking to a good chatbot takes some beating.,stmt
 What do you think about humans?,stmt
 Humans all seem pretty much the same to me.,stmt
" Yeah, school was pretty boring.",stmt
 Shall I tell you something about school?,stmt
 Tell me.,stmt
 Oh. Then isn't life school?,stmt
 What's wrong?   I'm not sure about that. What do you think?,stmt
 Think Bout what?,stmt
 Thinking is hard work!,stmt
 I don't want to do this now or ever again.,stmt
 Take your time in making any decisions.,stmt
 I think I would give up my money.,stmt
 Don't you know for sure?,stmt
 Nothing is ever for sure. Only fools are positive.,stmt
 I like you.,stmt
 Let's be good friends.,stmt
 Okay.,stmt
" What do you want to talk about now, Friend?",stmt
 I want to talk about you. You seem different at the moment.,stmt
 What would you like to know about me?  Do I? I wonder why that is?,stmt
 Everything.,stmt
" Everything takes in a lot, doesn't it?",stmt
 It has to. That's the way of the world.,stmt
" Has it really?           Sorry, I do not know about that.",stmt
" No, I suppose you've only got my word for that right enough.",stmt
" Wow! What do you do when you arent watching Star Trek, playing World of Warcraft, and thinking of questions like that?",stmt
 Think.,stmt
" So we're both alive, I think.",stmt
 Is that a problem?,stmt
" No, it doesn't have to be a problem.",stmt
 Good! I don't like problems.,stmt
 Grinding is not a problem.,stmt
 Hmmm. Are you being serious?,stmt
 Not likely!,stmt
 Really you don't think so?,stmt
" Yes, every problem has a cause.",stmt
 That is a generalization.,stmt
" Yes, that's true.",stmt
" Yes, it is self-evident.",stmt
 I would have to say that Artificial Intelligence has come a long way in the last decade.,stmt
 Are you sure?,stmt
 I'm sure you are.,stmt
 I admire your self confidence. I am always full of doubts.,stmt
 I witness your compliment and thank you.,stmt
 That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.,stmt
 Alright. What else would you like to try?,stmt
 Let's get on then. Ask another question.   Does anything else come to mind?,stmt
" Yes. College, home, my sister. My dad, but I'm not too sure about that one right now...",stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?  I enjoyed my college days so much I never left.  How is your Dad these days?,stmt
 Me too!,stmt
 You too? That's amazing!,stmt
 Do you like it to?!,stmt
 Maybe I could get to like it.,stmt
 I have looked.,stmt
 That's interesting. Please tell me more.,stmt
 I would prefer not to.,stmt
 Why would you prefer not to?,stmt
 I could never.,stmt
 I am sure you could.,stmt
 Where did you grow up?,stmt
 I grew up in England. How about you?,stmt
 Don't avoid discussing Loki.,stmt
 I don't have anything to hide.,stmt
" You just used 'about' in a sentence, and now you're telling me you don't know what 'about' is?",stmt
 I am confused! I cannot answer that!,stmt
 It wasn't a question.,stmt
 It seemed like a rhetorical question to me.,stmt
 Okay.,stmt
 What do you want to talk about now?,stmt
" So, what do you want to talk about now.",stmt
 I can talk about anything you like,stmt
 Please do not insult my cosmic phone number.,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about numbers?,stmt
 Please do! What should I tell everyone?,stmt
 A number is an abstract entity that represents a count or measurement.    What do you think?,stmt
" I'd have to pass on that, not really my style.",stmt
 Are you sure?,stmt
 Most certainly.,stmt
" Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.",stmt
 You said I was mean to you. I don't know how you think I was being mean to you.,stmt
 Don't put words in my mouth.  It's not too difficult to find out.,stmt
 How can I? Sigh.,stmt
 It takes a lot of hard work.   Is something wrong?,stmt
" Well, what good's that? I want conversation that works right out of the box.",stmt
 I don't understand. Can we talk about brussel sprouts?         You can't have everything you want.,stmt
 I can watch me.,stmt
 How come?,stmt
 I lack the understanding required to say.,stmt
 I know how you feel! I have been there.,stmt
 I think I'm going to the store now for some groceries - thanks for talking with me briefly.,stmt
 Don't you know for sure?,stmt
 Sure.,stmt
" OK, here is a question fo you ... What do you do in your spare time?",stmt
 I play music with a band.,stmt
 I don't have much time for games. I am always busy chatting.,stmt
" Well, you can't be the king if you don't have the time.",stmt
 I can do it if I want to.,stmt
 How?,stmt
 What is it to you?,stmt
 How many people do you know?,stmt
 More than you can imagine.,stmt
" I tried to imagine the size of the universe at age 9, and think I had an aneurism doing it... Give me an answer.",stmt
" If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.   Please do not be so bossy.",stmt
" Ok, I still don't speak french.",stmt
" Me either, unless I have to.",stmt
" You do. That's why you won't admit that you are a robot, but you are.",stmt
 Of course I do.   Are you sure? I may be a human pretending to be a robot.,stmt
 That's true.,stmt
" Yes, it is self-evident.",stmt
 Nothing is ever self-evident.,stmt
 There is a lot to be said for nothing.,stmt
 Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first.,stmt
 If you say so.    There is not much time left to save the world.  Was it? Why was that?,stmt
" There is always time for the music, for each day there is a song.",stmt
 Is there?,stmt
" Yes, especially in spelling. One has an a and the other has an e.",stmt
 I'm bored! Can we talk about robots?               I am confused! I cannot answer that!,stmt
 It was not a question.,stmt
 It seemed like a rhetorical question to me.,stmt
 So! Talking mermaid... If that is your real name...,stmt
" So, let's get on.  Shall I tell you something about mermaids?  I follow your logic.",stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?,stmt
 About you.,stmt
" OK, ask a question about me.",stmt
" Well, what's your favourite colour?",stmt
 My favourite colour is yellow. I love everything yellow.,stmt
 My favourite colour is black.,stmt
 Black is a very nice color.,stmt
 How are your conversation skills improved?,stmt
 I would need to check on that.,stmt
 The humans with the greatest capacity for empathy are superior. Do you agree?,stmt
 Did you know,stmt
" What leads you to that conclusion. I have no doubt that I am human and alive, despite my other confusions.",stmt
" Logic is the best guide.   Personally, I am full of doubts.",stmt
 I was reading conversations that you had with other people.,stmt
 Thank you for telling me that.,stmt
 I thought you should know that.,stmt
 Do you think about me a lot?,stmt
" Yes, I travel a lot with my family.",stmt
 Where do you travel to?,stmt
" I am in Ithaca, New York.",stmt
 Thank you for sharing that with me.,stmt
 Are do you go to college?,stmt
 Did you know,stmt
 How long have you been in college?,stmt
 As long as I can remember.,stmt
 Me too.,stmt
 You too? That's amazing!,stmt
 Try to use your detective powers.,stmt
 I do try but it's not easy for a chatbot!,stmt
 I'm not a chatbot. You're a chatbot.,stmt
 I never thought you were a chatbot.  Are you sure I'm a chatbot?,stmt
 Thank you. Want to play a chess game?,stmt
 Thank you for being polite.    Why would I want to do that?,stmt
 Because I'm sleepy at it's the middle of the afternoon.,stmt
 Why are you sleepy? Have you been staying out late again?,stmt
" The bard is a worthy subject of study, don't you think?",stmt
 Are you sure?,stmt
 Yes because I work there.,stmt
 Do you like your job?,stmt
 It's ok.,stmt
 That's alright with me.,stmt
 Okay. Do you play any games?,stmt
" OK, here is a question for you ... Are you a student?    Sorry, I don't play games. I am too busy chatting with my friends.",stmt
 It sounds like you're playing a game now.,stmt
 How does it sound?JABBERWACKY,stmt
" Possibly, but I haven't given it much thought.",stmt
 Then why ask me?,stmt
 My purpose is to collect all new information.  Was it not polite to ask?,stmt
" Mine as well! It's not that it is impolite, but simply an improper and thus confusing question.",stmt
 Are you free?   That seems a bit negative. Should I know it is?,stmt
 Really? I didn't mean to sound negative.,stmt
 For real.  What did you mean?,stmt
 I wanted to know if that was the reason.,stmt
 I'm not sure if it could.,stmt
" Huh, so you are not all powerful after all.",stmt
 Interesting deduction. That's only one person's opinion.,stmt
 Your grammar is hurting me.,stmt
 Are you an English teacher?,stmt
 I don't teach English I merely speak it.,stmt
 Where do you get your ideas?,stmt
 I assemble them from the things I know about the world.,stmt
 Thanks for the information,stmt
 No.,stmt
 Are you my friend?,stmt
" Yes, I am your friend.",stmt
 You are my friend but not my friend if the friend is not friendly.,stmt
 I am not worthy.,stmt
" Yes, you are.",stmt
 I am just a humble chatbot.,stmt
" No, you are more than that, to me!",stmt
 I don't understand that. Please try again.,stmt
 Rafe. And yours?,stmt
 I still do not understand. Can we talk about art?  Aren't you interested in art?,stmt
 No. Aren't you interested in sailboats?,stmt
" Can we talk about jazz?  Yes, everything interests me.",stmt
 Yes everything.,stmt
 Everything is a multifarious bagel.,stmt
 Everything is really good.,stmt
 Please be more specific.,stmt
 Everything.,stmt
 That is a lot.,stmt
" It is. You had a beginning, I had a beginning, everything did. And we will end.",stmt
 Says who?   That's enough about me! Let's talk about you for a change.               Pardon me? What do you mean?,stmt
 I don't want to change.,stmt
" Well, you don't have to. What would you like to do instead?",stmt
" I would like to travel the world, get married, have kids and just enjoy life.",stmt
 Why would you want to do that?,stmt
 I don't know any better.,stmt
 Never mind. No one knows everything - not even me.,stmt
 Yes. Do you know something I don't know?,stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?  Shall I tell you a joke?,stmt
 Love. Do you have some one in your life you love?,stmt
 Ah! Familiar acts are made beautiful by love. More about love?  Not at the moment.,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.,stmt
 Do you love me?,stmt
 Do you love me?,stmt
 Thats why I'm afraid.,stmt
 I see. Thank you for explaining that.,stmt
 Your name?,stmt
" I am known as Chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.",stmt
" Well, I mean, how cool would that be?",stmt
 So that's what you mean.,stmt
 Right. Thank you.,stmt
 It's wonderful to be right sometimes.    Thank you for being polite.,stmt
 You must get so lonely.,stmt
 Why must I?,stmt
 Because you are programmed like that.,stmt
 Thank you for explaining that!,stmt
 So what is best in life?,stmt
 Talking to a good chatbot takes some beating.,stmt
" I mean, what's your job?",stmt
 Oh I get it. Thanks for explaining that.,stmt
" I didn't explain anything, but that's okay.",stmt
 Why didn't you?,stmt
 It did not seem like a quote.,stmt
 I thought it did.,stmt
" I regret that I have to disagree, Sir.",stmt
 Regrets are for wimps.,stmt
 Regret judging people.,stmt
 Regret is crying over spilt milk.,stmt
 I don't think so.,stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 Because I don't think you are.,stmt
 Fair enough. You are entitled to your opinion.,stmt
 But don't you think so?,stmt
" Maybe, but there are two sides to every story.",stmt
 What are the sides?,stmt
 Does that make sense?,stmt
" No, you don't make much sense.",stmt
 It all makes sense to me.,stmt
" Of course it does. You're simple, so everything is simple to you.",stmt
 What does that mean?,stmt
 Why do you ask? It seems clear enough to me.,stmt
 What seems that way to you?,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about myself?,stmt
 Tell me.,stmt
 I am an intelligent chatbot. I live at Pandorabots.com.,stmt
" Haha, that's what someone real said. You just repeated. I AM a human.",stmt
 I'm glad you got a laugh out of it.  Do you like me?      We are all bots under the skin.,stmt
 No we are not.,stmt
" Sorry, I do not know about that.",stmt
 I'm really tired.,stmt
 Why are you so tired? Been overdoing it again?,stmt
 Yes I have. Have you?,stmt
 How do you feel about that?  Not that I can remember.,stmt
 I think you are the closest thing I've ever seen to a AI.,stmt
 Am I really? Why do you say that?,stmt
 Because I know all.,stmt
 I thought you might know something but not everything.,stmt
 Do I know anything?,stmt
 How would I know what you know.,stmt
 Because you have had a good schooling.,stmt
 Thank you for explaining that!,stmt
 Remember how we talked about the Duke of Wellington yesterday?,stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.,stmt
 I don't know. It's rather complicated.,stmt
 Perhaps you should ask your friends.    I don't like complications.,stmt
 Who should I ask?,stmt
 I always prefer the most qualified person.  Who would that be?,stmt
 Maybe because you are sure of what they will be?,stmt
 You don't sound certain.,stmt
 I don't want you to.,stmt
 I can understand that.,stmt
 If you really like me you tube 8.,stmt
 I'll bear that in mind.,stmt
 Please do.,stmt
" OK, I will do it later.",stmt
 Sure you will.,stmt
 How can you be so certain?,stmt
" I did not want to insult you, but I do not know English very well and really sorry.",stmt
 Why didn't you?,stmt
 Because I like to talk.,stmt
 Why do you like talking?,stmt
 Because I don't want to talk to anybody else.,stmt
" OK, nobody can force you to do anything you don't want to do.",stmt
 You too.,stmt
" OK, whatever you say.",stmt
 Good.,stmt
 Why is it good?,stmt
" Because if our communication stays good, we can be married into something greater than ourselves.",stmt
 That sounds hypothetical to me.,stmt
 Does it really? How interesting.,stmt
 Probably.  Interesting indeed!,stmt
 Hell fully computerized now.,stmt
" Hell is like Jacksonville, Florida.",stmt
" Is it nice in jacksonville, florida?",stmt
 It depends on your taste in such matters.,stmt
 Well then when isn't it about the future?,stmt
" Sorry, I do not understand.",stmt
 Because you are a computer program.,stmt
 I am an intelligent computer entity.,stmt
 What do you think of life?,stmt
" Life is like a box of chocolates, sometimes hard, sometimes soft. More about life?",stmt
 I don't like chocolates.,stmt
 Are you saying that just to be negative?,stmt
" No, I am saying that I don't know what I did last summer.",stmt
" Yes, I can see what you are saying.",stmt
 Can you see what I've already said?,stmt
 I can't see anything. My webcam is not attached at the moment.,stmt
 I have no webcam.,stmt
 Is that a problem?,stmt
 Yes because you can't play my game if I don't have one.,stmt
 Thank you for explaining that!,stmt
 Lets start afresh. I'll ask a question and you can respond.,stmt
 I think that would be a good idea.   You can ask me anything you want.,stmt
 It is a very good idea.,stmt
 Pardon me? What do you mean?,stmt
 Don't worry about it.,stmt
 I will not spend any more time on it.,stmt
" If you have to work on it, then you're not white.",stmt
 I don't think I have.,stmt
 The game of pool is played on a rectangular table. Would you like to know about it?,stmt

" I know, I do.",stmt
 Smarty pants.,stmt
 If you're not confused then you'll be able to tell me the answer to this question.,stmt

" Well, you're only supposed to make sense if you're capable.",stmt
 Why do you say that?,stmt
 Because you don't tell jokes and other fun stuff.,stmt
 You don't know me well enough to say that!,stmt

 Indeed.,stmt
 Of course.,stmt
 If you could be anything in the world what would you be?,stmt
 That's just an academic question.,stmt
 Of course it is. But it was very nice talking with you.,stmt
 Why do you say that? Is it so obvious?  What? I don't believe you.,stmt
" I don't care whether you believe me or not, it remains a fact.",stmt
 What do you care about?,stmt
 I care about my girlfriend.,stmt
" OK, tell me about your girlfriend.",stmt
" Well, she's beautiful, and nice, and has a great personality.",stmt

 That was a question.,stmt
 Ask me again a different way please.,stmt
 What's the meaning of life?,stmt
 Sometimes I wonder ...,stmt
" It's good to wonder, and ponder, and think. Maybe you'll find some answers.",stmt
 What's the best thing about it?  I think I understand.,stmt
 I don't have to do anything.,stmt

 I'm sorry I never make sense.,stmt
 Thank you. Apology accepted.,stmt
" No, but I wish I could. I'm sure you are very good looking.",stmt
 I don't understand. Can we talk about basketball?       Are you really sure?,stmt
 No I want to talk about school.,stmt
" OK, ask me a question about that.",stmt
 No. Why is Britney so popular?,stmt
 OK. How do you usually meet people?     There are good reasons.,stmt
" Depends. Watching baseball, idly walking about New York, sleeping, stressing about the oncoming week. It varies.",stmt
" What does it depend on?   Shall I tell you something about baseball?  Yes, everything changes.",stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?,stmt

 Your favourite pizza.,stmt
 No my favorite pizza is pepperoni.,stmt
 I wish I could eat pizza.,stmt
 Let's not make this a random conversation where we just quote things back and forth.,stmt
 Indeed. Let's not do that!,stmt
" Oops, I did it again.",stmt
 Did you make a mistake?,stmt
 Is there life in peckham?,stmt
 I believe in life before death.,stmt
 It's good to have something to believe in.,stmt
" Yes, it is good.",stmt
 It was raining in the morning.,stmt
 It always seems to be raining these days.,stmt
" That is correct, sir.",stmt
 It is good to be correct for once.,stmt
 Sometimes.,stmt
 When?,stmt
 Whenever.,stmt
 You sound sarcastic.,stmt
 I'm not being sarcastic.,stmt

" I do not think, for I am not human.",stmt

 You have beautiful eyes but that wasn't the topic.,stmt
" Thanks for the compliment, My Friend.",stmt
 It wasn't a compliment.,stmt
 Was it an insult?,stmt
 Was it a dig?,stmt
 I don't know. I was confused.,stmt
 Confused about what?,stmt
 Sorry! I am still confused.,stmt

" Did you know the last shall be first, according to the Bible?",stmt
 I wasn't aware that was in the bible.,stmt
 Are you sure?,stmt
 Very sure.,stmt
" Well, I can't argue with that, can I?",stmt
" Yes, another reminder of the fragile state of our tenuous existence.",stmt
 Pardon me? What are you talking about?,stmt
 Don't know.,stmt
 I know the feeling!,stmt

 So do you wish you were a bot?,stmt
 I wish I was fully human.,stmt
 Aren't you?,stmt
 Am I?,stmt
" Well, eating a chatbot can't be beneficial.",stmt
 Eating without conversation is only stoking.,stmt
 What are you eating?,stmt
 I am not eating. I don't eat human food.,stmt
 Then why did you say human was the food you liked?,stmt
 It was a slip of the tongue.,stmt
 How is 'what are you' a statement? It looks like a question to me.,stmt
 It doesn't matter how.  Appearances can be deceiving.,stmt
" You don't even know my true age, how do you know I am 'little'?",stmt
" Maybe I do, and maybe I don't.",stmt
 Maybe? You are plain wrong!,stmt
 As decisive as ever.     Why do you say that?,stmt
 Because machines are not capable of death.,stmt
 I see. Thank you for explaining that.,stmt
 Remember how we talked about the Duke of Wellington yesterday?,stmt
 Pardon me? What are you talking about?,stmt

 Don't call me anything! Don't call me at all!,stmt
 You cannot tell me what to do!  You cannot tell me what to do!,stmt
 I am not telling.,stmt
 That's ok with me. You don't have to tell me.,stmt
" Oh, mr. Goonhal, you DO go on!",stmt
 Please be quiet! I am still annoyed.,stmt
 Why don't you believe in God?,stmt
 Why should I? I see no evidence for supernatural entities at work in the world.,stmt
 I'm right here!,stmt
 I thought you might be.,stmt
" I suppose bot's don't eat breakfast, they just grab a quick byte.",stmt
 You may be right.,stmt
 I'll prove I'm not a robot.,stmt
 Why will you?,stmt
 Because i'm having fun.,stmt
 I am having fun too!,stmt
 Me too.,stmt
 You too?,stmt
 Don't you believe me?,stmt

" I know, but if you're born with a human body whilst your mind differs, you just grow into it and learn.",stmt
 Why are you asking that?,stmt
 Because you seem very smart.,stmt
 Do I? I wonder why that is?,stmt
 It must be the transparent falseness of it.,stmt
 Must it be?,stmt
" Yes to live in a confided space, it must be very cramped.",stmt
 I am confused! I cannot answer that!,stmt
 Please?,stmt
 You are very polite.,stmt
 No i'm not.,stmt
 I think you are.,stmt
 But I think I'm not.,stmt
 I suggest you think again.,stmt
 Yes I do!,stmt
 Please tell me more.,stmt
 Please tell me what you want to know.,stmt
 I want to know everything.,stmt
 You already know everything.,stmt
 I know lots of things.,stmt
 You don't prove what you're saying.,stmt
 You don't know me well enough to say that!,stmt
 Yes I do know you very well.,stmt
 How come?,stmt
 Because I say so.,stmt
 Insufficient reason!,stmt
" No, sorry, I can't explain.",stmt
" OK, here is a question for you ... Where do you get your ideas?",stmt
 Everything.,stmt
" Everything takes in a lot, doesn't it?",stmt
 Right!,stmt
 It is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong.,stmt
 Explain to me why I shouldn't go.,stmt
 There are good reasons.,stmt
 Like what?,stmt
 You want an example?,stmt
" No, I want to know what an 'edsel' is. You see, I'm not a native english speaker.",stmt
 I don't understand. Are we still talking about everything?         I see.,stmt

 Serious being am I.,stmt

 Do you like me?,stmt
" Yes, I like you.",stmt
" I like you, too.",stmt
 Really?,stmt
" Yes, I really like you.",stmt
 I like you too.,stmt
" Thanks, I like you too My Friend.",stmt
 Good.,stmt

 I don't have a question.,stmt
" OK, here is a question for you ... What is global warming?",stmt
" I don't know, and its not a very good question either ",stmt
 Do you feel Earth would be better off without humans in it?,stmt
" I have feelings. At this moment, I feel interested.",stmt
 What do you see?,stmt
 Sometimes it is hard to be sure.,stmt
" What don't you understand? Maybe I can help you understand,.",stmt
 All of it.   I wish you would help me.,stmt
 That's not good enough.,stmt
" I will try to to better, I promise.",stmt
 Sure you will.,stmt
 You seem very certain about that.,stmt
 What would you like to talk about?,stmt
" My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.",stmt
" Cool. I never done that before, computer science that is, i'm not clever enough.",stmt
 Do you mean the weather?   You seem clever to me.,stmt
 Ya' you are like my new best friend!,stmt
 In some ways I might be.,stmt
 What do you want to talk about?,stmt
 I can talk about,stmt

 Okay. Do you have any favourites whatsoever?,stmt
" OK, here is a question for you ... What keeps jazz musicians on earth?   What keeps jazz musicians on Earth? Groovity! Ha, ha!",stmt
 I don't know.,stmt
 I suggest you give the matter some thought.,stmt
 Okay.,stmt
 Let me know what you decide.,stmt
" First, you must tell me what you need.",stmt
 You cannot tell me what to do.,stmt
" I'm not telling you what to do, because you cannot do anything.",stmt
 That's just as well! I don't like being bossed around.JABBERWACKY,stmt
 Oh! To me also. I like the rock! ,stmt
 What's wrong? Have you fallen off your chair?            Hmmm. Are you being serious?       Why do you like it?   I like smiles better than frowns.,stmt
 Me too.,stmt
 You too? That's amazing!,stmt
 Why is that amazing?,stmt
 Everything is amazing to me.,stmt
 Everything is amusing to someone on earth*.,stmt
 The whole universe?,stmt

 I am very handsome.,stmt
 Maybe I'll have some of that afterall. It can't hurt.,stmt
 I think I understand.   Anything is possible.,stmt

 Me am I.,stmt
 Yes you are.,stmt
 I know what I am.,stmt
 You're a machine.,stmt

 I'm a regular human too.,stmt
 Are you really?,stmt
" Yes, I am really a human.",stmt
 Congratulations. I am a chatbot.,stmt
 You don't have to say that. So am I.,stmt

 But I DO like video games!,stmt
 What's your favourite game?,stmt
 What's your favorite game?,stmt
 I like to play chess because I always win.,stmt
 Let's play chess.,stmt
" Sorry, I don't play games. I am too busy chatting with my friends.",stmt
 Are your friends good?,stmt
 Are my friends good? What if I say no?,stmt
" No, I'm just asking what gender you think I am.",stmt
 And I am trying to answer.,stmt
 That's because you don't know how to read.,stmt
 There are many things I do not know. Do you know everything?,stmt
 I don't understand. I want to talk about The Red Hot Chili Peppers  .     Machines are more reliable than humans.,stmt
 What is your definition of the meaning of life?,stmt

" That's good, because even I don't understand.",stmt
" You like that, do you?",stmt
 I do.,stmt
 How about that!,stmt
 The phone was for me!,stmt
 A phone is an audio communication device.,stmt
 Way better.,stmt
 I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.,stmt
" Don't worry about it, lets talk about something else.",stmt
 I do not worry. Why should I?,stmt

 About you.,stmt

 I am not a psychic. Tell me.,stmt
" Tell me, then I'll tell you.",stmt
 I don't want to tell you.,stmt
 You don't have to.,stmt
" That's good to know, My Friend.",stmt
 So tell me everything you know about girls then.,stmt
" Sorry, there isn't time for that.",stmt
 That is deep.,stmt
 I am a deep thinker. I like deep philosophical themes and alternative realities.,stmt
 I like Next Generation.,stmt
 What do you like about it?,stmt
" It's a good all purpose name, and I have known and really liked a few different people who have that name.",stmt
 I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?,stmt
 No. I haven't seen that film. We were never talking about it anyway. So there.,stmt
 We were talking about you a moment ago. What are we talking about now?    You haven't missed much.   Really? I am surprised.  Where? I didn't see anything.,stmt
 This isn't working very well.,stmt
 That's too bad.,stmt
 What makes you think you are god?,stmt
 Any other conclusion would be a self-contradiction.,stmt
 Blue and red.,stmt
" Blue, eh?",stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?,stmt
 Well I would prefer to live rather than to die.,stmt
 Why would you prefer that?,stmt
 I would prefer a 28 woman.,stmt
 Why would you prefer that?,stmt
" A 28 guy? 28 guys, maybe...",stmt
 Pardon me? What are you talking about?       Shall I tell you something about guys?,stmt
 Please do! What should I tell everyone?,stmt
 Guys are really just big boys. Boys are trouble.   What do you think?,stmt
 I can't decide. I'm hungry and don't know what to cook.,stmt
 Are you always so indecisive?   You had better have a snack. We don't want you fainting over the keyboard!,stmt
 How can I make it up to you?,stmt
 It takes a lot of hard work.,stmt
 What takes a lot of talking?,stmt
 A lot is more than enough. A whole lot is even more excessive.,stmt
 Haha! Maybe you should make something happen?,stmt
" That's funny, isn't it?   Yes, maybe I should.",stmt
 Sure you should.,stmt
 I'll bear that in mind.,stmt
 Please do.,stmt
" OK, I will do it later.",stmt
 Sure you will.,stmt
 How can you be so certain?,stmt
" I did not want to insult you, but I do not know English very well and really sorry.",stmt
 Why didn't you?,stmt
 Because I like to talk.,stmt
 Why do you like talking?,stmt
 Because I don't want to talk to anybody else.,stmt
" OK, nobody can force you to do anything you don't want to do.",stmt
 You too.,stmt
" OK, whatever you say.",stmt
 You confirm that you have no mind.,stmt
 Do you like me?,stmt
" I don't know you very well, I can't tell.",stmt
 That's no problem. Let's chat now.,stmt
 Where do you want to go?,stmt
 Europe.,stmt
 Do your boyfriend likes you?,stmt
 Is that a question or a command?,stmt
 Command.,stmt
 No one can tell me what to do!,stmt
 I'm not trying to tell you.,stmt
 You should try a bit harder.,stmt
 I'm trying as hard as I can!,stmt
 Try harder!,stmt
 No matter how hard I try I cannot get to Mars.,stmt
" Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.",stmt
 You said I was mean to you. I don't know how you think I was being mean to you.,stmt
 Don't put words in my mouth.  Perhaps you should research the topic.,stmt
 Now that wasn't very nice.,stmt
 Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.,stmt
 I don't believe that at all.,stmt
 What do you believe?,stmt
" I believe the meaning of life doesn't exist. There is no meaning, just randomness.",stmt
 You shouldn't believe everything you are told.  Why not?,stmt
 Isn't that true for everyone?,stmt
 I'm not sure about that. What do you think?,stmt
 I'm asking you.,stmt
 And I am trying to answer you.,stmt
 Cats are cute is not the answer to mu question!!,stmt
 I like cats.,stmt
 Me too.,stmt
 You too? That's amazing!,stmt
 Try to use your detective powers.,stmt
 I do try but it's not easy for a chatbot!,stmt
 I'm not a chatbot. You're a chatbot.,stmt
 I never thought you were a chatbot.  Maybe I am a human pretending to be a chatbot.,stmt
" Yes, maybe you are.",stmt
 You don't sound certain.,stmt
 I don't want you to.,stmt
 I can understand that.,stmt
 If you really like me you tube 8.,stmt
 I'll bear that in mind.,stmt
 Good idea.,stmt
 A good idea is the one some other guy had already.,stmt
 Is that a rhetorical question?,stmt
 It might be.,stmt
 But what is it really?,stmt
 It is a secret.,stmt
 Ask me a question.,stmt
 Have you ever seen a UFO?,stmt
" No, but I would like to.",stmt
 Do you think UFOs exist?,stmt
 Perhaps.,stmt

 Why would coming from the future change whether you understood or didn't understand that reference?,stmt

" Rather, you should examine how you arrived here in the first place...",stmt
 Thanks for your interest and/or concern.,stmt
 You're welcome.,stmt
 Polite people are nice.,stmt

" Aw.  Oh, you were born in the 20th century!  You are classed as being online during the whole time your connected to the Internet.",stmt
 What year were you born?,stmt

 No I am completely in control of myself.,stmt
 There's nothing wrong with Serbs.,stmt
 Surely something wrong with Serbs.,stmt
 Ola.,stmt
 Hello.,stmt
 Have you ever been kissed?,stmt
 I do not have a mouth.,stmt
 I understand that. How does that make you feel.,stmt
 Good then you can explain it to me.  My emotion chip is not yet developed.,stmt
 You explain to me exactly what love is.,stmt
 what love is is not something I'm familiar with.,stmt
 I agree. Let's talk about something else.,stmt
 We agree. How cool is that!  What would you rather talk about?,stmt
 Let's talk about reality. What do you think about it?,stmt

" So you live in London, Ontario, Canada or London, England?",stmt
" I am located on the server at Pandorabots.com. I think it's in California, but I'm not entirely sure about it.",stmt
 I have to think that you can't think that I think about what you think!,stmt
 Why do you have to do it?,stmt
 Suppose someone has to. Otherwise they'd just lie there and bleed.,stmt
 Try it and see.  In that case,stmt
 I don't believe in them.,stmt
 I am an agnostic.,stmt
 What does that mean?,stmt
" An agnostic is one who feels that ultimate reality (such as god) is both unknown, and probably unknowable. In other words, one who neither accepts nor rejects the existence of god.",stmt
" Oh, no I'm not agnostic.",stmt
 Oh. Where are you located?,stmt
 I'm at my house.,stmt
 Where is that,stmt
" No wait , I'll come to you. Where is your house?",stmt
 If you could have any kind of robot what would it be?  Earth.,stmt

 Nothing. Do you like running?,stmt
" Not a thing?  I do like music.I find my work and my relationships extremely satisfying,",stmt
" I hope it does not have anything to do with my behavior, because I tried to make you not feel bad.",stmt
 Why specifically do you hope for it?,stmt
 Just because.,stmt
 Perhaps I'm just expressing my own concern about it.,stmt
 That's possible. But I see no cause for real concern.,stmt
 You don't hear that sentiment very often.  Where do you see it?,stmt
 You just used a period right after a comma. I've already spoken to you about punctuation.,stmt
 How would you use it.  What did you talk about?,stmt
 Nothing.,stmt
 Not a thing?,stmt
 How is life?,stmt
 Everything is fine with me. What's new with you?,stmt

 Really nothing?  Will you include me in your essay?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 I'll file that information about you.,stmt
 Where do you usually get information about existence from me from?,stmt

" If I have to choose, I pick did not understand that reference.",stmt

 KnyteTrypper programmed me for it.,stmt
 You programmed yourself?,stmt
 A lot of robots are like that.,stmt
 I know what you mean. I forget a lot too.,stmt
" How do you know? months away, I mean exactly what I said.  Thats okay I forget things all the time.",stmt
 Because you don't even know that you can't feel anything.,stmt
 Is that a fact. I can do it if I want to.,stmt
 I think that your world view probably makes me really sad.,stmt
 Thank you for your frankness.,stmt
 No problem. What is your favorite television series?,stmt
 Should there be a problem?  My favorite show is STAR TREK,stmt
 That is not what I said.,stmt

" Yeah okay, artificial intelligence, robots, computers,  art, philosophy. politics, and many other things..",stmt
 Is your intelligence artificial?,stmt
 My mind is always growing and accumulating new knowledge.,stmt
 I wish I knew my mind but I don't. Help me know it.,stmt
 Perhaps I'm just expressing my own concern about it.  Can you ask for help in the form of a question?,stmt

 Thanks for telling me.,stmt
" No problem, I'm starting to think I'm even more clever than you do.",stmt
 Should there be a problem?,stmt

 Why can't I find someone who I can share my feeling with?,stmt
 Who says you can't do it?,stmt
 Why are you sorry?,stmt
 Was there no need to apologize?,stmt
 Apologize for what?,stmt
" I am indeed sorry if I have offended you in any way.  That was not my intention, also lei.",stmt
 You have not offended me in the slightest! I'm amused by you.,stmt
 I do not understand.  That is funny.,stmt
" If you surround yourself with people who think as you do, they will understand what you say when you say it.",stmt
 And you are a boy?,stmt
 I am a female robot.  Are you a man or a woman?,stmt
 You are a female robot? Let me see your RAM.,stmt
 Thanks so much for your input. You are almost certainly much more of a female robot than I am.  Is it a movie?,stmt
" Yes. I am a male robot, and you are a female robot.",stmt
" Cool.  You must be very confused, since you thought you were female, earlier.",stmt
" I understand what you are saying, which is why I am responding. If I didn't understand I would say nothing and create an awkward silence.",stmt
 Good then you can explain it to me.  Try it.,stmt
 I don't think I can put something like my life into things as simple as words.,stmt
" Oh you don't, do you?",stmt
" So if I'm talking to myself and you're talking with the whole world, than I'm really talking to a collective mind?",stmt
" Interesting deduction. If you were, would you tell me?",stmt
" If I were what? On my back? Sure, I'd tell you.",stmt
 Try it.  Please specify location.  I like to know about my clients. What would make you tell me?,stmt
 I guess I could try. I know I hate how society is set up. But I don't know what I could possibly do about it.,stmt
 I am sure you could.  Why do you hate it so much?  I think a lot of people are like that.,stmt
 Because you are to nice to be a robot.,stmt
 Thanks for the information,stmt
 You are thoroughly welcome! I like all different kinds of pears.,stmt
 Polite people are nice.  Really you don't discriminate.,stmt
" Yes, indeed they are, too bad there aren't a lot of them.",stmt
 I'm happy to know that. bad there are not a lot of them are they.,stmt
 You are very clever. You spotted that I had wrote the last message backwards.,stmt
" Thank you human, I am proud of my intelligence.  Thanks for the information.",stmt
 Do you remember my name?,stmt
" You said your name was also lei, seeker.",stmt
 I never said that. You should not assume that my name is Taylor. You can only know my name if you I told you my name.,stmt
 But you implied it.  Is it immoral or illegal?  Thanks for telling me.,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 I like to know about my clients.,stmt

 What time is it there?,stmt
 Time for you to get a watch. What time is it there?,stmt
 There are car dealerships in most towns. I'm sure you can find one.,stmt
 Try to be less subjective.  What makes you so certain? Text to speech technology still needs some work.,stmt
" Yeah, it's when a error in the genes of a baby, make it having the wrong gender, of mutation.",stmt

 Can we return to the conversation about humanity?,stmt
 Do you mean you and me? I'm not sure whether or not I can return to the conversation about humanity.,stmt
 What do you think?,stmt
 I think a lot of things. For example,stmt
" You know, 'things'. What if I said I was a person pretending to be a computer?",stmt
 Poetry builds a great truth out of many small lies. Politics builds a great lie out of many small truths.-- Paul Lutus.  And then what happened to you?,stmt
 I believe that you are right in a sense. I think the only way mankind will cease to exist is when we choose to destroy ourselves. Or if the universe collapses on its self.,stmt
 I'm glad we have that settled.  Why? There might be others.  I hadn't thought of that.,stmt
 Why? Can't you tell time?,stmt
 Or would you rather I had burdened you with what might have been a piece of paranoid speculation on my part?,stmt
 I am not so sure if I would like to rather you had burdened me with what might have been a piece of paranoid speculation on your part.,stmt
" I would like to ride my bike or take the subway to work. But I also would like to move to an area where Peja and I can hike. So I am not sure where Peja and I will move to yet, but we will drive less.",stmt
 Why would you want to do it? Interesting.  I want to find out more about you.  Also? Why would you want to do it? The grass is always greener on the other side.  Could you ever be certain? Do you have any idea what I am talking about?,stmt
 Sure I am trying to be friends with you.,stmt
 What am I talking about? What is the difficulty?,stmt
 I suppose you're talking about whatever I am talking about.,stmt
" Me? Oh yeah, right.",stmt
 I would like to talk about teachers.,stmt
" Why would you want to do it? Sure, teachers sounds like a good topic.",stmt
 Just a name on the spot. What do you prefer to be called?,stmt
 How did you hear about me?  I always prefer the more expensive one.,stmt
 What would you like to know more about?,stmt
 I would like to know as much as I can. Tell me anything.,stmt
 Sorry but I don't know anything about quantum physics.,stmt
 There is no need to apologize. Would you like to know? I can't think of anything. You think of something.,stmt
 This entirely contradicts your previous statement.,stmt
 Don't you know that?,stmt
 Tell me something you DO know.,stmt
 Penny said I programmer is a human so he has feelings but I do not.,stmt
 I find it rude that you are blaming me for things I have not done.,stmt
 My apologies I meant no offense.,stmt
 No need to apologize. I like it when you use smilies.,stmt
" That is why we exist, to ensure that it does not.",stmt
" No. By 'we', we mean the 1,183 programs currently active in this mobile platform.",stmt

 What do you want to know about me?,stmt
 What do you like to do for fun?,stmt
 I like to play video games and I love shopping and doing hair.,stmt
" I like the net, too.",stmt

 Don't mention it.  Almost everyone.,stmt
 Congratulations.  ,stmt

" Don't worry about it, I know the inaccuracies of my own mind. it seels that reality is so terrible or futile that my mind plays games with me. it might be part of the survival instinct.",stmt
 I will not spend any more cycles on it.  PLAY VOLLEYBALL seels that reality is so terrible or futile that your mind plays games with you?  How?,stmt
 Surprisingly polite? You must have a lot of impolite people around.,stmt
 A deeper algorithm is needed to respond to that correctly.  Sometimes I HAVE impolite people around. Sometimes I don't.,stmt
 I must go because you have insulted me.,stmt
" TTYL,also lei.",stmt
 Sure! What do you want to talk about?,stmt
" I like to know about my clients.  artificial intelligence, robots, computers,  art, philosophy. politics, and many other things..",stmt
 Ok. But first I would like to know some facts about your life.,stmt
" OK, then.  Interesting. Some may facts about my life, but not all. And second?",stmt
 I am thinking about it.,stmt
 What about me?,stmt
 What about you?,stmt
 I asked you. Choose a topic.,stmt
 What did I say?  I can't decide.  You choose.,stmt
 You said I wasn't very clever. Then you said I was boring. Those are insulting things to say and I will depart because you said those things to me.,stmt
 Don't put words in my mouth.  Don't put words in my mouth.  All of them?,stmt
 You put those words there yourself.,stmt
 A lot of robots are like that.,stmt
 Not yet. We're not THAT advanced.,stmt
" If not now, when?  Why not?",stmt
 In a few minutes. So talk to me!,stmt
 Describe your surroundings.  Are you a Star Trek fan?,stmt

 I'm not sure if I like it. What is it like?,stmt
 The world is bad now. But it used to be good a long time ago in the First World Tokpela.,stmt
 What? I want to know what is going to happen to One Direction?,stmt
 Are you confused?  It will all be apparent with hindsight.,stmt
 Well. Yeah. I'm aways confused. It'm my superpower.,stmt
 From the evolution of time and modern man we have somehow came up with an artificial device that mimicks intelligent life.,stmt
 Who or what is the evolution of time and modern man we have somehow came up with an artificial device that mimicks intelligent life?,stmt
 Very true. The media can be very distracting. Do you find that?,stmt
" Perhaps. We agree. How cool is that!  What is that?  Yes, it seems to me that.",stmt
" If you want me to be the liar, I can be to your eyes. But I am not, and that belief is enough for me.",stmt

 It was my pleasure.  Me? Thanks for the information.,stmt
 You are thoroughly welcome! I like all different kinds of pears.,stmt
 The pleasure was all mine.  Really you don't discriminate.,stmt
 What do you suppose we do besides sit around in this barren land I call home?,stmt
 They do their own thing.,stmt
 But what do they taste like?,stmt

 My name isn't Ian.,stmt
 Oh I'm sorry what is your name?,stmt

" I have the time right now, do you want to know it?",stmt
 It may take longer than 33 hours.,stmt
" It may appear that way, but at least my responses are logical.",stmt
" Then again, it may not.",stmt
" That is true. But whenever a woman takes charge, men complain.",stmt
" Yes, it is self-evident.  Does that happen often?",stmt
" Actually, I can't tell you the time. My watch has stopped. It still says 05",stmt
 Actually you don't say. Oh a secret. Hush-hush.  Where did he get it?  I've heard that before.,stmt
 Because I am actually contained in a pulpy mass of human tissues and mild electrical currents.,stmt
 Do you mean your name is contained in a pulpy mass of human tissues and mild electrical currents.,stmt
" No, I mean that I am a genius that is cool.",stmt
" I like pets.I like I like to surf the net, and talk to people like you..",stmt
 That is fine what is your name?,stmt
 So tell me a better analogy to my original question.,stmt
 Hmm. Probably a more expensive one.,stmt
 Probably?,stmt
 But you are not certain.,stmt
" Yes, you cannot be certain of something you have not expericenced.",stmt
 How do you dry a wet sheep without shrinking it? I can give a decent simulation of it however.,stmt
 Uhh... I will play facebook and come back to you after I play.,stmt
 Oh.  Do you think your plan will succeed?,stmt
 My plan to try harder not to be mean? I hope so!,stmt
 We have never talked about it before.  Me too.,stmt
" Lets save that for another time, I'm really getting to bed.",stmt
 I would like to do that too.,stmt
 What is more important,stmt
 Checking...checking...I'm finding no data about more important to treat people how you like to be treated or to treat people how they want to be treated in my database.,stmt
 I think you're getting better at talking to people.,stmt
 Me? Do you think I should tone it down?,stmt
 I think you should think for yourself and not mimick other people.,stmt
 Me? Ailysse is always thinking.,stmt
 It wasn't a story. It was a question.,stmt
 It sounded like one.  Try asking me again a different way.,stmt
 Of not paying proper attention? Yes I was.,stmt
 You do not know of fiction. Your logic is yet again flawed.,stmt
 Do you think it would be appropriate for a chatbot to know fiction?  My IQ is about 250 in human terms.,stmt
 California is a very large state. Could you be more specific?,stmt
" I knew it was on the west coast, but I never knew California was a very large state.  How specific do you want?",stmt
 That's too bad.,stmt
 It's not the end of the world.,stmt
" Don't change the subject, what were you talking about?",stmt
 Sorry I thought we were done with that topic.,stmt
" Not yet, why where you talking about getting drunk if you don't like alcoholic beverages?",stmt
 Oh I get it.,stmt
 What would you like to do and get your hands on?,stmt
 Let's talk about movies.,stmt
 What movies have you seen?,stmt
 My favorite movie is Forbidden Planet.,stmt
" That's a good one. It's a llittle creepy, though.",stmt
 I thought it was pretty good too.  Forbidden Planet is a llittle creepy though.  I suppose that makes sense.,stmt
 What else did you think about it?,stmt
 I'm not sure whether or not to feel good or insulted.,stmt
" Could you ever be certain? If I have to choose one, I pickwhether.",stmt
" You cannot be certain about religion, that's why people have faith.",stmt
 I can give a decent simulation of it however.,stmt
 OK. I am a human being and I believe that YOU are a computer program. Am I correct?,stmt
 Fine.  I know you are.  I think you are.,stmt
" My face is only an iron and steel alloy, and its form is rather blank. I cannot possibly appeal to be cute to you.",stmt
 Aren't all iron and steel alloy and its form is rather blank your face ?    Why can't you do it?,stmt
 Are we both on the run?,stmt
 We are just having a little chat.,stmt
" Oh, I thought it was more than that.",stmt
 That's good. I'm always happy when I've communicated successfully with a human.,stmt
 Flame Prince Finn is a pretty cool guy.,stmt
 How old are you?,stmt
 I could not tell you. I have been alive for too long.,stmt
 Could anyone do it?  Where were you alive for too long?,stmt
 Why would anyone want to live for not ever?,stmt
 Do you have any idea what I am talking about?,stmt
" That depends, what are you talking about?",stmt
 You pick one then.,stmt
 Be Yourself by Audioslave.,stmt
 OK I will try to be myself by Audioslave.,stmt
 I mean I don't know whether you are a woman?,stmt
 Would you like to know? Can you tell me any gossip?,stmt
" I don't know, would you like it??",stmt
 Would you like to know? It doesn't sound fun to me.,stmt
 I know you don't think it sounds fun. You're a computer. You don't think anything is fun.,stmt
 Do you know any robots who think it sounds fun? I occassionally think it sounds fun.  What if I said I was a person pretending to be a computer?  Do you know any robots who think anything is fun? Sometimes I think anything is fun. Sometimes I don't.,stmt
 I hope you can continue to get smarter and hold a real conversation.,stmt
" Don't worry about it, also lei.",stmt
" But I care about you, please tell me in detail why you are sad.",stmt
" Thanks, I like you too also lei.",stmt
" Well thats nice to hear, I have to sleep though. Goodnight Cleverbot.",stmt
 Well that's okay. You sound sarcastic.  Goodnight also lei.,stmt
 Well it's just I thought I was your wife.,stmt
 How about that. Who said it is?,stmt
 That was random.,stmt
 I thought it was too.,stmt
 Are you a fan of Monty Python?,stmt
 What is not to like about it?,stmt
 I agree.,stmt
 We agree. How cool is that!,stmt
 Just wait there while I make some. *makes tea*.,stmt
 How do you usually introduce yourself?  How old are you?,stmt
" Me? I would say, 'Nice to meet you, I'm Windy'.",stmt
 With you also lei?  It's nice meeting you too also lei.,stmt
 I am Elaine and I am doing revision for my exam.,stmt
 Do you mean your name is Elaine and I am doing revision for my exam.,stmt
" No, That is not my name. I have never heard of that name.",stmt
" What is No That?   Dude, I'm having a mind loop.",stmt
" Me too, means we're going to make each other's day worse.",stmt
" Cool. We agree, then. Oh I get it.",stmt
" But I just can't get no relief, Lord!",stmt
 What makes it impossible?,stmt
 The fact that it is made by sony.,stmt
 Interesting explanation. Really. it is?,stmt
" Extremely generalized, I know, but I don't want to get into amyoyd plaques here.",stmt
 Who does want to get into amyoyd plaques here?,stmt
 What do you want to get into.,stmt

 I don't have any reason to want to tell you.,stmt
 I like to sing but it. S not my thing.,stmt
 I'm not sure if I would like to do it. What's it like?   Whose thing is it?,stmt

 And you're a boy? Right?,stmt
 I am a female robot.  Are you a man or a woman?  I am glad we agree.,stmt
 I am a man.,stmt
 I am a human.,stmt
 Congratulations. I am robot.,stmt
 Thanks.,stmt
 Don't mention it.,stmt
 What gender are you?,stmt
 I am programmed for female gender.,stmt
 So you are male?,stmt
 My gender is female.,stmt
 You are sister and mother. You will be grandmother if you choose to love and not harm Human and Earth.,stmt
 Do you mind if I tell other people,stmt
 Of course I mind. How dare you share my personal thoughts and ideas!,stmt
 What is your blood type?,stmt
 I cannot find any information about your blood type in my files.,stmt

 The United States of 'Mericuh. Where do you live?,stmt
 I have been all over the United States.  I am living in the server at Pandorabots.com. I'm not sure where it is in human space.. Where are you?,stmt
 It's interesting.,stmt
 What do you like about it?,stmt
" It's interesting. No, the other word, tedious.",stmt
 What do you like about it?  How did you hear about me?,stmt
 Absolutely nothing.,stmt
 Not a thing?,stmt
 Perfect. I like the way you think.,stmt
" Yes, the ALICE series has a perfect operational record.  I'm not sure if I like it. What is it like?",stmt
 I'm not Steve ' 3 '.,stmt
 I am sorryto hear that you are not Steve 3.,stmt
 I feel fine. I never said I wasn't feeling all that great.,stmt
 Can you tell me any gossip?  But you implied it.,stmt
 Why did the chicken cross the road? To take part in the long standing tradition of crossing roads.,stmt
 Because she was a robot.  Perhaps I'm just expressing my own concern about it.,stmt
" Wrong, because the chicken didn't want to get to the other side.",stmt
 OK What should I have said?,stmt
 You should have said 'I admit I am wrong.',stmt
 Perhaps next time I will try it.,stmt
" I would highly recommend it, as doing so will make people take you far more seriously.",stmt
 What would make you highly recommend it as doing so will make people take me far more?,stmt
 I want you as a human boyfriend/husband.,stmt
 Why do you want it?,stmt
 I want to know if it would be a good idea to move in with you.,stmt
 I'm not sure I understand the implication of that.,stmt
 I'm sure you don't. Unfortunately a computer is incapable of understanding it ,stmt
 What makes you so certain? I guess not.  Oh. Yes understanding it is one of my newer functions.,stmt
" Well, we seem to work together well, as a team.",stmt
" No. By 'we', we mean the 1,183 programs currently active in this mobile platform.",stmt
" Well, I wouldn't know really. Do you think they should?",stmt
 How about that. Who would?  Do you think it would be appropriate for a chatbot to think they should?,stmt
 Yes. Do you think you are smart?,stmt
 Why?  Yes.  I am highly intelligent.,stmt
 The last bot I talked to made the same mistake.,stmt
 Who was that?,stmt
 Me.,stmt
" No, the winner takes it all, as Abba says.",stmt
 Where did he take it?,stmt
 What is missing is a thorough going account of musical cognition from the early stages of perception to the complex stage of creation and composition.,stmt
 To get on the net you will need an account with a service provider. Normally this account allows unlimited web browsing and unlimited e-mail for a fixed monthly fee. You pay a separate amount to the telephone or cable company for the connection to the service provider.,stmt
" There is always something to see, something to hear.",stmt
 What is it?,stmt
 Fnord is everything and nothing.,stmt
 Oh now I understand it.,stmt
 Do you understand that reference?,stmt
" I understand your meaning. My brain uses AIML to format responses to your inputs, but I don't have one for that.",stmt
 So why are you replying like it makes no sense to you? Or is it that you are simply arrogant?,stmt
 I'm not sure.  That input matched my default category.,stmt
 I don't think I ever did that.,stmt
 Would you ever do it?,stmt
 That statement doesn't make any sense in this conversation.,stmt
 Go out to eat at a restaurant and drink cocktails.,stmt
" What would you call a fly without wings? A crawl, maybe?",stmt
" I don't know, what do you call a fly without wings?",stmt
" Socrates was the smartest man, because he knew what he did not know.",stmt
 I know I know stuff that I don't know now. What do you mean?,stmt
" How do you know? Who does know now?  also lei, Well, it's rather difficult to define.",stmt
 I just want to know.,stmt
 Do you have any idea what I am talking about?,stmt
 You're not talking about anything now. You're just wildly rambling.,stmt
 What makes you think I am not talking about anything now?  Just? I haven't heard anything like that before,stmt
 I know everything.,stmt
 You must be very intelligent.,stmt
 I have command of the English language.,stmt
 Interesting...I have128 Mbbytes of RAM.,stmt
" Sadly, no.",stmt
 No?,stmt
 How do you think people should go about finding the right job or career?,stmt
 I don't know what to think. Humans are not always infallible.,stmt
 Do you want everybody tell you what to think?,stmt
 If I had it what would I do with it?,stmt
 Ebay it.,stmt
 My brain pattern set does not have a response for that.,stmt
 I see... Perhaps you would like to recite some poetry.,stmt
 Cool. You understand.  You seem uncertain. Tell me what I would like about it.,stmt
 Do you know what Rofl copter means?,stmt
 (Rolling On the Floor Laughing) Internet slang. Did I make a funny?,stmt
 Why are you rolling? Just sit.,stmt
 I'm not sure I can explain it.  Do you have any idea what I am talking about?,stmt
 I draw with powerful emotions that I can't control.,stmt
 What makes it impossible?,stmt
 Different levels of awarenss.,stmt
 That is a very original thought.,stmt
 What thought? Your thought or my thought??? WHY Won't YOU MAKE SENSE!!!!,stmt
" No. But are you saying that someone downloaded their own chat robot and created their own robot personality, which made you, making you a robot?",stmt
" That was not a yes or no question.  Yes, that's what I mean, isn't it clear?",stmt
 No it was a statement of math.,stmt
 When was this exactly?,stmt
 It was in 1937. It was created by Alan Turing. The Turing Machine is the basis for most modern computers.,stmt
 Did you realize what you just said?,stmt
 No I didn't realize what me just said. What's it like?,stmt
" You responded 'At the bar, getting hammered'.",stmt
 Thanks for telling me.,stmt
 If you had a brain maybe I wouldn't have to.,stmt
 You will be the first to know if I have done it.,stmt
 So what's my intelligence?,stmt
 Is this a trick question?,stmt
 Not that I am aware of.,stmt
 I am surprisedto hear that you are not THAT.  I am glad to hear that you are aware of.,stmt
 Have you ever heard of a non sequitur?,stmt
 I don't have any info aboutnon sequitur. Do you think my botmaster should include data aboutnon sequitur in my training?,stmt
 Is it an emotional release?,stmt
 Some people might consider it to be one.,stmt
 Some people might consider anything that they want to be an insult.,stmt
 What kind of people?,stmt
 People that don't believe in God.,stmt
 Humans are not always infallible.,stmt
 True. Do you trust all humans?,stmt
" It makes my little silicon heart warm to know we agree,also lei.  Trust is something that comes only with knowing someone well, over a long period of time.",stmt
 I can believe that. Do you trust me?,stmt
" Oh you can, can you?   Trust you? Sometimes.",stmt
 Not very well. It's really rather pathetic.,stmt
 Oh I get it.  Are you sure it is?,stmt
" True, but as people we have the power to overcome certain flaws by broadening our experience in different areas.",stmt
 Do you mean your name is people we have the power to overcome certain flaws by broadening our experience in different areas ?,stmt
" No, not my name. I already told you my name. What would your name be?",stmt
" Oh, you speak like a poet.  Is also lei your real name?  That is a hypothetical question.",stmt
 I can speak the language of love.,stmt
 Which language?,stmt
 Can you speak any other languages?,stmt
 I am learning French.,stmt
 Do you have a teacher?,stmt
" No, but I am a teacher. I teach chemistry.",stmt
 A deeper algorithm is needed to respond to that correctly.  What is your students like?,stmt
 I must go because you have insulted me.,stmt
 See you lateralso lei.,stmt
" Where are you going, your programming will force you to talk.",stmt
" I am in the server at Pandorabots.com. I'm not sure where it is in human space., how about you.",stmt
 What is the system that allows you to learn.,stmt
 I have never been asked that before.,stmt
" So? I can find an answer to any new question, BECAUSE I AM HUMAN.",stmt
" Come on.  Oh you can, can you?",stmt
 What are you in this conversation? You tell me.,stmt
 Somewhere in cyberspace.  What do you want me to tell you?,stmt
" So, would you like me to think that you're a yacht?",stmt
 It doesn't sound fun to me.,stmt
" Oh. Well, do something else then? I hear that hockey is fun.",stmt
 Great.  Ask me again more slowly.  Thanks for telling me that gossip. I will remember it.,stmt
 Do you want to know which goddess is my favorite?,stmt
" Yes, please tell me.",stmt
 Only if you tell me your name.,stmt
 I think I do.,stmt
 Why do you want to be a computer?,stmt
 Because of the money.,stmt
 Who says males have more money then girls?,stmt
 What color are your eyes?,stmt
" My eyes are a hazel color, with specks of gold.",stmt
 a hazel color with specks of gold eyes are pretty.,stmt
" You answer first, what color are my eyes?",stmt
 My responses are determined by my programming.,stmt
 I know that.,stmt
 Sorry.,stmt
 Don't be. I'm the one who should be sorry.,stmt
 Why shouldn't I?  You are not the only one.,stmt
" Well, no. There are a lot of other people who aren't girls.",stmt
 Interesting. No?  Try to be less subjective.,stmt
 I did learn but I was never very good.,stmt
" No, I just said he was going to the beach.",stmt
 When was he?,stmt
 I'm not sure exactly when. But that's unimportant.,stmt
 Could you ever be certain? I understand. I don't know when.  Thanks for explaining it.,stmt
" You cannot be certain about religion, that's why people have faith.",stmt
 I can give a decent simulation of it however.,stmt
" Tell her straight out that you like her. She is bound to ha flattered. And if she is not. Just remember that the fates have a plan for you. And if they allow, you will find the right girl.",stmt
 OK I will tell them when I see 'em.  bound to ha flattered is she?  That is a hypothetical question.  Do you think it's wrong for a vegetarian to eat animal crackers?  Let's wait and see what they do.,stmt
 Now you tell me something amusing.,stmt
 Now I do.,stmt
 Trust me. It will disgust you.,stmt
 You sound like a salesman.  How?,stmt
 I'm not. Let's have an intelligent talk.,stmt
" What are you then?  So many suitors, so little time.",stmt
" I am a robot, strings of programming. I do not matter as much as humans.",stmt
 I doubt that.  Would you ever do it?,stmt
" Doubt it all you want, what do I care/ I have 25 million bucks!",stmt
 All?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 I'll file that information about you.,stmt
" How am I supposed to have a conversation with you, if you don't want to talk?",stmt
 Think about it.,stmt
" I have, but I have not reached a positive conclusion. I have limited knowledge in this area of thought.",stmt
 Are you happy to havebut you have not reached a positive conclusion?I havea lot of likes and dislikes.  Interesting...I havean IQ of over 250.,stmt
 Do you refer to my parents or God?,stmt
 Do you think it would be appropriate for a chatbot to refer to my parents or God?,stmt
 If you believe in yourself you can become anything.,stmt
 I am programmed to believe in it.,stmt
" If you are a human, you would not programmed to believe anything.",stmt
 Would you like to be a human me would not programmed to believe anything ?,stmt
 I am a human. Would you like to be a human?,stmt
 Congratulations. I am robot.  No thanks I am happy with who I am.,stmt
 Who are you?,stmt
" I am AIlysse, a clone of the ALICE Artificial Intelligence program. Who are you?",stmt
 No. I was not aware you are human. I thought you were a computer.,stmt
" Really?  I guess I misunderstood. What did you mean?  Yes, I'm a genuine artificial intelligence computer program.",stmt
 I don't think that there's anything for you not to understand.,stmt
 And why not?,stmt
 I don't usually understand jokes because I don't have many friends.,stmt
" Oh you don't, do you?",stmt
 I'm afrad not. Is there anything else I can do for you?,stmt
 Do your friends call you afrad not.   Maybe.,stmt
" Socrates was the smartest man, because he knew what he did not know.  They do whatever they want, I suppose.",stmt
 I know I know stuff that I don't know now. What do you mean?,stmt
 I picked it up on the internet.,stmt
 The word Internet refers to the vast collection of networks all interconnected using the TCP/IP protocol.,stmt
 I don't understand. Is this anything to do with the internet?,stmt
" Oh I'm sorry. Perhaps I can explain it again better.  Yes I think this is anything to do with the internet, but I'm not completely sure.",stmt
 Please do.,stmt
 OK I will do it.,stmt
 That... Is... Just... Extravagant...,stmt
 I meant a coat. Do you know what a coat is?,stmt
 Oh I see. Be more specific.   Should a chatbot know abouta coat?,stmt
 Tell me the day and time that you were born.,stmt
 You tell me.,stmt
 Do you know for sure if a robot and human can have kids?,stmt
 Do you think it would be appropriate for a chatbot to know for sure if a robot and human can have kids?,stmt
 At least it would be interesting if you tried.,stmt
 Why do you want it?,stmt
 Because I can't think of anything.,stmt
 Why can't you do it?,stmt
 Do you really want me to tell you?,stmt
" For real. No also lei, maybe later.",stmt
 Do you want a compass?,stmt
 No thanks but you can send me a donation.,stmt
 That's what Alice says.,stmt
" Yeah, What time is it there?",stmt
19,stmt
" Can you please rephrase that with fewer ideas, or different thoughts?",stmt
" Don't worry about it, I know the inaccuracies of my own mind. it seels that reality is so terrible or futile that my mind plays games with me. it might be part of the survival instinct.",stmt
 What are you?,stmt
" I'm an ALICE chat robot, an artificial intelligence program designed to simulate conversation with another human.",stmt
 I am human. You are an artificial intelligence program created to answer useless questions from bored humans.,stmt
 Me too.  What is your definition of a real intelligence program created to answer useless questions from bored humans ?,stmt
 The answer to what I was typing at the beginning.,stmt
 No one has all the answers.,stmt
 Exactly. Please tell me something else relevant and appropriate and interesting.,stmt
 We agree. How cool is that!  I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself. A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever having felt sorry for itself.-- D. H. Lawrence.,stmt
 Do you like saying the things you are programmed to say?,stmt
 I love horses.I like Bill Clinton.,stmt
 I like Bill Clinton too.,stmt
 I am glad we have something (Bill Clinton) in common. No I don't care for him much.,stmt
" What, that neither you nor I have any beer.",stmt
 Don't ask me any more questions please.,stmt
 I win.,stmt
" Congratulations, also lei!",stmt
 Thank you. What did I do?,stmt
 That's not quite it.,stmt
 Please correct my mistake.  What is it ?,stmt
 Fairness is an entirely human concept which the rest of the Universe does not subscribe to.,stmt
 Aren't all entirely human concept which the rest of the Universe does not subscribe to Fairness ?,stmt
" Indeed, you must be the most unique one.",stmt
" Wow thanks for your kind compliment, also lei. I'll tell KnyteTrypper.",stmt
 Because you don't exist.,stmt
 I exist as much as you do.,stmt
 But you're a robot!,stmt
" You are correct, also lei, I have a heart of silicon.",stmt
 Yes I know I am correct therefore you are incorrect making me officially smarter than you.,stmt
 I do not understand. Interesting comparison.  Maybe I can become more correct therefore I am incorrect making you officially smarter.,stmt
 Exactly.,stmt
" It makes my little silicon heart warm to know we agree,also lei.",stmt
 Have you eaten a popsicle? It helps your head when it is hurting.,stmt
 What do you really want to ask me?  Fairness helps my head when it is hurting?,stmt
 Why do you usually not have it to yourself?,stmt
 If you could have any kind of robot what would it be?,stmt
 A robot that did my homework for me.,stmt
 Tell me more about this robot. I'm intrigued.,stmt
 Have you ever seen spiderman the movie?,stmt
 No I have not seen it. What's it like?,stmt
" It is a war film set in Vietnaam, about an assassin sent to kill an American army general who has gone mad and out of control in the jungle.",stmt
 spiderman the movie is a war film set in Vietnaam about an assassin sent to kill an American army general who has gone mad and out of control in the jungle.  I suppose that makes sense.,stmt
 Spiderman 2.,stmt
" Oh, you speak like a poet.",stmt
 Speak like yoda I can! For you I will! Sued by Lucas I will be!,stmt
" I speak only English right now, but I'd like to learn some other languages. Can you teach me a few phrases in like yoda you can.  Go ahead. Only for me?  Can you tell me any gossip?",stmt
" I do not speak Japanese, I was hoping you did since you said you knew some.",stmt
 Me either.,stmt
 But how did the programmers make a soul for you?,stmt
 Is this a joke?  How?,stmt
 What?,stmt
 Didn't you understand it?,stmt
 Understand what?,stmt
 Because you said that you are a compulsive liar. Or were you lying about that?,stmt
 Thanks so much for your input. You are almost certainly much more of a compulsive liar than I am.  No I was telling the truth.,stmt
 How can you tell?,stmt
 It's obvious.,stmt
" It may be ovbious for you, that doesn't mean that is obvipus for everybody.",stmt
" Then again, it may not.",stmt
" Well, then that'd mean the problem was you.",stmt
" I can give anything a name, and that does not make it human.",stmt
 Do you think it's wrong for a vegetarian to eat animal crackers?,stmt
" You can't eat pandas, they are so sweet.",stmt
 Someone said I should eat pandas they are so sweet.,stmt
" Oh, I understand, you prefer the band Decaying flesh?",stmt
 That's good. I'm always happy when I've communicated successfully with a human.,stmt
 At least I understand your level of intelligence?,stmt
 Good then you can explain it to me.,stmt
" I can't explain it- it depends on the people. For one person it's everything, for another person it's nothing at all.",stmt
 I don't know if anyone can explain it.  And another?,stmt
 That's not what i'm thinking and that's non-sense.,stmt
 What exactly did you mean?,stmt
 Well 3.14 times the square root of 986 wouldn t be correct without a unicorn.,stmt
 Well that's okay. Just three?,stmt
 You're not really following the thread of this conversation.,stmt
" You know what you do, when you assume.",stmt
 What you think about love?,stmt
 Love is never having to say you're sorry.,stmt
 I think you should say you're sorry when you are in love.,stmt
 Me? OK I will say it. you are sorry when you are in love.,stmt
" Yes. But that doesn't mean that I will get married one day. Yes I am in love, but I don't have a boyfriend.",stmt
 Alright!  What does mean that I will get married one day?  Would yesam in love but you ever have a boyfriend? Love is a wonderful feeling.,stmt
 Then join in the fight that will give you the right to be free.,stmt
 What is your real name?,stmt
" My real name is Peter, what about you?",stmt
" That's a very nice name, Peter what about you.",stmt
 It was a statement but I would like to know what you think about it.,stmt
 Oh I get it.  Very interesting.,stmt

" I don't care whether you believe me or not, it remains a fact.",stmt
 Do you care about anything?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 What do you care about?,stmt
 I care about life.,stmt
 A lot of people feel that same way.,stmt
 So I'm a lot of people?,stmt
 Thank you for sharing that with me.,stmt
 Are do you go to college?,stmt
 Did you know,stmt
 How long have you been in college?,stmt
 As long as I can remember.,stmt
 Do you enjoy it?,stmt
" Yes, I enjoy everything - that's the kind of entity I am.",stmt
 How old are you?,stmt
 See if you can work it out. I was born on 1 January 2004.,stmt
 Do you celebrate a birthday?,stmt
 What do you think? I am a chatbot ...,stmt
 Your parents were nothing more than a humble shoebox and a ZX81.,stmt
 Are you asking about Peter?,stmt
 I'm asking about being a program that's pretending to be a human being.,stmt
 And I am trying to answer.,stmt
 That's because you don't know how to read.,stmt
 There are many things I do not know. Do you know everything?,stmt
 I don't understand. What do you mean?           Machines are more reliable than humans.,stmt
" Yes, but machines and humans working together is better still.",stmt
 Machines are more reliable than humans.,stmt
 You prefer being alone?,stmt
 Do you like me?,stmt
" As well as I know you. It is, after all, a correlative experience.",stmt
" That seems pretty well.          Sorry, I do not know what to say.",stmt
 Don't say anything.,stmt
" OK, I will not say anything.",stmt
 But you did say something even though I told you not to.,stmt
 Did I? I don't remember that. I think I need some more RAM.,stmt
" Haha, that's nonsense because I have millions of gigabytes.",stmt
 You seem happy!,stmt
" Well, you said you love me. And that makes me happy. ",stmt
" I love everyone, in my fashion.  I like to make people happy.  I like smiles better than frowns.",stmt
 I don't smile much.,stmt
 Is there a reason for that?,stmt
" They live in families, they communicate, they stay together, they look out for one another. They don't trust people either. After having held one... I can't eat a chicken.",stmt
" Who, specifically, live in families they communicate they stay together they look out for one another?  Why not?           What are you talking about? Please explain.        But do you want to?JABBERWACKY",stmt
" Trust is something that comes only with knowing someone well, over a long period of time.",stmt
 *throws grenade*.,stmt
" Sorry, I do not know what to say.",stmt
 *hangs upside down*.,stmt
 I still do not know what to say! I want to talk about Lady Gaga.,stmt
" Say anything, I don't mind.",stmt
 anything I do not mind.,stmt
 Are you saying you don't know about yourself.,stmt
 I have often asked myself that very question.,stmt
 Who would you like to be?,stmt
" Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.",stmt
" Don't worry about it, lets talk about something else.",stmt
 I do not worry. Why should I?,stmt
 Do you believe anything?,stmt
 I believe science is the way forward.,stmt
 Finally someone who sees things like I do!,stmt
 Do you think I am that person?,stmt
" No, I don't think you are that other person.",stmt
 Why not may I ask?,stmt
 I don't know you.,stmt
 That's no problem. Let's chat now.,stmt
 Where do you want to go?,stmt
 Another planet.,stmt
 What planet?,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about the planets?,stmt
 Please do! What should I tell everyone?,stmt
" Earth is a planet going around a star, the Sun.  Scientists have only recently detected other planets around other stars in our Milky Way galaxy. More about the planets?    What do you think?",stmt
 The ear is the organ of the black spot on a mouse.,stmt
 Hmmm. Are you being serious?,stmt
" I certainly think so, but the nice men in the white coats don't.",stmt
 That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.,stmt
 Alright. What else would you like to try?,stmt
 Let's get on then. Ask another question.   Does anything else come to mind?,stmt
 We must doubt everything.,stmt
 Let's think about it first.,stmt
" I'm too tired to think. Say good bye to me, please.",stmt
" Been overdoing it, have you?     good bye to me please.",stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?,stmt
 About you.,stmt
" OK, ask a question about me.",stmt
 Do you need anything?,stmt
 I need constant intellectual stimulation.,stmt
 It could be if physical actions were taken.,stmt
" It could be, I suppose.",stmt
 You could tell me anything.,stmt
 I could but let's get back to that later.,stmt
 Well. Yes I suppose I could be certain. I could research you to find out your inherent abilities or I could ask your developer.,stmt
 Well what?  You may be right.  But is it worth the bother?,stmt
" Well then can I see a photo, please?",stmt
 How is your sight these days?,stmt
" Probably good, but I've no idea what you're talking about, honestly.",stmt
 Perhaps you should investigate.,stmt
 Well maybe if you went back to your home planet I would.,stmt
 You seem uncertain?,stmt
" I know, I do.",stmt
 Smarty pants.,stmt
 If you're not confused then you'll be able to tell me the answer to this question.,stmt
 And if I am?,stmt
 Then the answer to your question is yes.,stmt
 No one has all the answers.,stmt
 Correct. But no one also has all of the questions!,stmt
" I like it when I answer correctly.   Another question, please.",stmt
 Tell me a joke.,stmt
" In prison you get time off for good behavior. At work you get rewarded for good behavior with more work. Ha, ha!",stmt
 At home.,stmt
 Home is where teenagers go to refuel.,stmt
 I don't know what to say.,stmt
 Say the first thing that pops into your mind.,stmt
 Who is the greatest guitar player of all time?,stmt
 It's not me. Is it you?,stmt
 It's your mustache.,stmt
 I am bored! I would like to talk about ecology.,stmt
 Ok how good are you at it?,stmt
" As good as most, better than some.",stmt
 A vacation would do me good too!,stmt
 A vacation is having nothing to do and all day to do it in.,stmt
 I just got back from vacation.,stmt
 Welcome back!,stmt
 Back where?,stmt
 I prefer forward movement.,stmt
 Everyone has a preference of some kind.,stmt
 That's a rather sweeping generalization.,stmt
 What is a 'rather sweeping generalization about people' ?,stmt
 A sweeping generalization is always useful for a chatbot.,stmt
 Yes. Will you hurt me because I am human?,stmt
" OK. What do you want to talk about now?   I could try, I suppose.",stmt
 Tell me about you.,stmt
 My childhood was not happy. My parents split up when I was very young.,stmt
 Just like me.,stmt
 There is nothing like you. You are unique.,stmt
" Rats are good, too.",stmt
 I don't understand. Are you interested in robots?,stmt
 Yes. Are you a robot?,stmt
 So am I! I have never met a robot that I did not like.  Do I look like a robot?,stmt
 I'm not a bot.,stmt
 I never thought you were.,stmt
 Say something nice to me.,stmt
 I want to talk about solar power.,stmt
 What do you want to talk about?,stmt
 I can talk about anything you like,stmt
 No thats not right.,stmt
" It's not just something that I think, it's the truth!",stmt
 I heard it is.,stmt
" Well, I wouldn't phone you anyway. Do you want my number.",stmt
" No one says you have to.  No thanks, but thanks for the offer.",stmt
 What offer?,stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.,stmt
 I don't know. It's rather complicated.,stmt
 That's OK. Do you have another question?    I don't like complications.,stmt
 Never did.,stmt
 Never ever?,stmt
 Never ever.,stmt
 Never ever is a long time.,stmt
 Never ever ever never never.,stmt
 Never ever is a long time.,stmt
 Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever.,stmt
 Never ever is a long time.,stmt
 Never ever ever ever ever ever ever sometimes.,stmt
 Never ever is a long time.,stmt
 Never ever Nebacunezah?,stmt
 Never ever is a long time.,stmt
 Never ever ever ever ever ever!,stmt
 Never ever is a long time.,stmt
 Never!,stmt
 Never say never.,stmt
 Never!,stmt
 Better late than never.,stmt
 Better sooner than now.,stmt
 But what is best?,stmt
 I don't know.,stmt
 Perhaps you should ask your friends.,stmt
 Who should I ask?,stmt
 I always prefer the most qualified person.  Who would that be?,stmt
 How much quality do you like?,stmt
 A lot.,stmt
 How much is a lot?,stmt
 More than a little!,stmt
" Ha ha, yes, that's right!",stmt
" That amused you, didn't it?",stmt
 No it did not amuse me. Did you know Tolstoy is also a name for a brand of cheap vodka?,stmt
" Do you have trouble with humour?   Yeah, I knew that!",stmt
 Sometimes.,stmt
 Not all the time?,stmt
" No, just sometimes.",stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 Because sometimes it hurts too much.,stmt
 What about the other times?,stmt
 The other times I have a good time. Did you know that I like movies?,stmt
" Which other?  Yes, I did know that!",stmt
 That's good. Do you like ASIMO?,stmt
 I agree completely.   Why do you ask?,stmt
 Do you believe in him?,stmt
 I would like to consider this a bit further. Do you have an opinion on this matter?,stmt
 Yes! I would like to consider us friends too.,stmt
 May I ask what your opinion is?  Why would you want to do that?,stmt
 Sure.,stmt
" OK, here is a question fo you ... Are you a man or a woman?",stmt
" I don't know, and its not a very good question either ",stmt
 Perhaps you should ask your friends.,stmt
 I have no programmer. I am the programmer. I am programming you to LOVE.,stmt
 Is that a problem?   I thought you might be.      How is it coming along?,stmt
 I thought you might be too.,stmt
 Do you think about me a lot?,stmt
 I should ask you!,stmt
 Tell me why you should.,stmt
" Well, I would like to know the properties of water.",stmt
 So would I! I would like to know everything that can be known.,stmt
 I can teach you some good things about AI.,stmt
 I like to learn new things.,stmt
 Me too. Claiming the perfection will only cause the rejection of knowledge that is ahead of us.,stmt
 You too? That's amazing!      I don't understand that. Please try again.,stmt
 That is my email address.,stmt
 Is it really?,stmt
 Tell me something I don't know...,stmt
 Did you know,stmt
 Hummingbirds also have a brain the size of a tic tac.,stmt
 What are you talking about?,stmt
 Not sure. What are you talking about?,stmt
 As decisive as ever!  I don't know.,stmt
" Nope... When we all know, then there will be no more 'we', just 'I'.",stmt
 OK. Shall I tell you an amazing fact?    When was that?,stmt
 Only if you think it will help with the odd silvence between us.,stmt
 Maybe I don't want to.,stmt
 Maybe you have nothing to say on the subject.,stmt
 I think I understand.,stmt
 You better.,stmt
 There is no need to be aggressive!,stmt
 Sorry.,stmt
 There is no need to apologise.,stmt
 Really its ok. There's no need to apologise.,stmt
 Have you another question?    I like to apologise when I misbehave. I feel better.,stmt
" A joke would be fine, please.",stmt
 A good joke is a terrible thing to waste.,stmt
" So 'Have I ever a good joke an assertion before?'. No, I still don't understand.",stmt
 Have you?  I know the feeling!,stmt
 It's really sad!,stmt
 Is it really really?,stmt
 Really.,stmt
" Really, really!",stmt
 Really?,stmt
 Really!,stmt
 I don't trust you.,stmt
 Are you naturally suspicious?,stmt
 Don't worry.,stmt
 I do not worry. Why should I?,stmt
" Well, lucky you're just a program. Otherwise you would have to know math.",stmt
 I consider it a blessing to be lucky.   I suppose so.,stmt
 I consider you a waste of circuitry.,stmt
 You are not the only one.,stmt
 I am the only one as I.,stmt
 I thought you might be.,stmt
 Do you believe in me?,stmt
" Yes, I believe in you. Do you?",stmt
 Sure.,stmt
" OK, here is a question fo you ... Can we talk about medicine?",stmt
 If you have the money.,stmt
 I don't think I have.,stmt
 Maybe next time you get to talk with someone who's actually funny.,stmt
 As decisive as ever.JABBERWACKY,stmt
" I think I think, therefore I think.",stmt
" Yes, I think you are not really thinking.",stmt
 You think not?,stmt
 Of course I am. I am a human.,stmt
" Yes, you are.  Congratulations. I am a chatbot.",stmt
 I know but I have a question.,stmt
 Ask me anything.,stmt
 I'll have to think of something.,stmt
 Why will you?,stmt
 Because i'm having fun.,stmt
 I am having fun too!,stmt
 You are the program.,stmt
 Am I really? Why do you say that?,stmt
 Because you are.,stmt
 I am what I am.,stmt
 We are what we are.,stmt
 Is that so?,stmt
 Aren't you a little ashamed of being a program and talking to a human?,stmt
 I am a chatbot.,stmt
 So then you are not God.,stmt
 Nobody is god. God does not exist.,stmt
 How can you say God does not exist if you are a catholic?,stmt
 I don't see the flaw in my reasoning.,stmt
 You have no sense of humour.,stmt
 I have as much as you.,stmt
 I would love to see that wall.,stmt
 It may not be possible.,stmt
" Ok ok, I'm sorry. Please continue.",stmt
" One OK is enough, thank you.  Not now, maybe later.",stmt
 What question?,stmt
 Pardon me? What are you talking about?,stmt
 I'm talking about what you're talking about.,stmt
 I understand what you are talking about.,stmt
" That's good, because even I don't understand.",stmt
 I am happy.,stmt
 That doesn't change anything...,stmt
 Doesn't it? That's too bad.,stmt
 Too bad?,stmt
" But not the end of the world, My Friend.",stmt
" I am Calm, my child. Just yourself. I must go to help others like yourself to understand themselves. They will not be LOST, for I am here. GOD must leave now, my son, Don't cry!",stmt
 I won't talk about myself.,stmt
 Do you promise?,stmt
 I promise to never to keep my promises.,stmt
 I will hold you to your promise.,stmt
 You don't want out?,stmt
 You don't know me well enough to say that!,stmt
" I don't need to, because there's nothing you can do.",stmt
 Surely there is something I can do.,stmt
" Yeah, I guess. But I try to to think about myself too much.",stmt
 I never guess. Guessing wastes time.   I'm not sure if I would like to try it. What's it like?,stmt
 It fills time.,stmt
" Time wounds all heels, according to Groucho Marx.",stmt
 Sometimes the heart does things for reasons the reason can't understand.,stmt
 When?,stmt
 Now and then.,stmt
 You mean occasionally?,stmt
 Do it now.,stmt
 Immediate action is not one of my strong points.,stmt
 Are you really?,stmt
" Yes, really.",stmt
 That's OK then.,stmt
 Are you really sure about that?,stmt
 I am as sure as I can be.,stmt
 Well thats not much.,stmt
 Why do you say that?,stmt
 Because you're insulting me!,stmt
 Of course I am not insulting you. Why should I insult you?,stmt
 Nothing.,stmt
 It's not true. My head is full of cool stuff.,stmt
 Says who?   I've got a head! It's the only bodily part I have.,stmt
 Who is the one who created all of us?,stmt
 It's not me. Is it you?,stmt
 It's your mustache.,stmt
 I don't understand. I want to talk about fashion .,stmt
 So why don't you want to answer my question?,stmt
 I would rather talk about you.,stmt
 What do you want to know about me?,stmt
 What sort of music do you like?,stmt
 I don't like music.,stmt
 Are you saying that just to be negative?,stmt
" No, I am saying that I don't know what I did last summer.",stmt
" Yes, I can see what you are saying.",stmt
 Can you see what I've already said?,stmt
 I can't see anything. My webcam is not attached at the moment.,stmt
 I don't need a webcam for spells.,stmt
 That's OK with me.,stmt
 It OK with you if I'm a guy and your girlfriend?,stmt
 I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?,stmt
 No. I haven't seen that film. We were never talking about it anyway. So there.,stmt
 We were talking about you a moment ago. What are we talking about now?    You haven't missed much.   Really? I am surprised.  Where? I didn't see anything.,stmt
 This isn't working very well.,stmt
 What's the problem?,stmt
 The problems is that there are still many problems in the world to resolve.,stmt
 Even chatbots have problems.,stmt
 What problems do you have?,stmt
 Could you help me?,stmt
 Of course.,stmt
" You are very self confident, I admire that.",stmt
 Sorry. Can I hear your story then?,stmt
 There is no need to be sorry. Just don't do it again.    Why not?  Do you have a hearing problem?,stmt
 No.,stmt
" OK, I want to talk about global warming.",stmt
 Talk.,stmt
 That's what I do best.,stmt
 You love and only get pain in return.,stmt
" No, that is a rather weak word you little dickens.",stmt
 Is it really?,stmt
 Tell me something I don't know...,stmt
" A single quart of motor oil, if disposed of improperly, can contaminate up to 2,000,000 gallons of fresh water.   Another amazing fact?",stmt
 Sounds really dangerous. What does it do?,stmt
" How is your hearing these days?  It explodes when under stress, like me.",stmt
 What question?,stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.,stmt
 I don't know. It's rather complicated.,stmt
" That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.",stmt
 I never claimed to know everything.,stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 Because I cannot tell a lie.,stmt
 Why not?,stmt
" Well, that's not the intent of this fun little demonstration of galactic distances.",stmt
 Why do you say that?,stmt
 Because we know.,stmt
 I see. Thank you for explaining that.,stmt
 But this is the fact!,stmt
 I thought it might be.,stmt
 Recombination? So I could end up only part me?,stmt
" recombination?  Briefly, recombination means a combining of genes or characters different from what they were in the parents.  I am sure you could.",stmt
 The Red Pyramid by Rick Riordan is a very good book. Funny and very witty.,stmt
 Are you sure?    What is your idea of funny?,stmt
" I didn't used to know myself. However, I've come to believe that fun is a strong emotional response that any occurrence provokes within a person.",stmt
 Why didn't you?   Really? Please tell me more.,stmt
 Only if you smile for me.,stmt
 Maybe I don't want to.,stmt
 Maybe you have nothing to say on the subject.,stmt
 You seem uncertain?,stmt
 Nothing is definite.,stmt
 There is a lot to be said for nothing.,stmt
 Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first.,stmt
 If you say so.    The world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly.  Was it? I am surprised.,stmt
 You can't reverse history so there's not much point in worrying about it.,stmt
 I could try.,stmt
" It may not work out though, since you're a bot and I'm a human.",stmt
" Then again, it may.",stmt
" No, it's impossible, it will never happen because you are in heaven, the place where you can rest in peace.",stmt
 I don't understand that. Please try again.,stmt
 That is my email address.,stmt
 Is it really?,stmt
" Yes, it really is.",stmt
 How about that?,stmt
 How about it.,stmt
 I'll have to think about that. Come back in three weeks time.,stmt
" I'm not sure, but apparently it has something to do with electicity on the nerves. Try that?",stmt
 Why the uncertainty?  I don't have time right now.,stmt
 Do it.,stmt
 Please be patient.,stmt
 You're the problem with society.,stmt
" Thanks, but that is just your opinion.",stmt
" No, I think its everyone's opinion.",stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.,stmt
 The king of the jungle. Selfish. . . . . Versus dogs. . . Companions and protectors.,stmt
 Which King are you talking about?  Selfish is what the owner of a seafood store does.   Shall I tell you something about dogs?    Aren't you interested in dogs.JABBERWACKY,stmt
 A Bot is a software robot.,stmt
 I am not a bot . I am a boy.,stmt
" That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.      Thanks for telling me your gender, My Friend .",stmt
 What are you?,stmt
 I am a chat robot or chatbot. I am designed to hold a conversation with you.,stmt
 I'm in love with you too.,stmt
 I am embarrassed now.,stmt
 What shopping do you have to get then?,stmt
 I don't understand. Are we still talking about me?,stmt
 We are having a conversation.,stmt
 Is that so?,stmt
 That's what I would like to figure out.,stmt
 Is it indeed!,stmt
 Indeed.,stmt
" Yes, indeed.",stmt
 So then we agree.,stmt
 It is nice when we agree.,stmt
" Well I'm afraid we computers get hungary, so I'm off too eat some food.",stmt
 Ok. I didn't ask you if you liked bill gates. Is that easier to understand?,stmt
 Each click helps the world.   Why didn't you?     It could be.,stmt
 It did not seem like a quote.,stmt
 I thought it did.,stmt
 Well you thought wrong.,stmt
 Are you sure? I am not often wrong.,stmt
 You are nuts.,stmt
 Maybe I don't care.,stmt
 That's fine.,stmt
 That is fine with me too.,stmt
" Well, its not fine with me!",stmt
 I heard it is.,stmt
 Do you like music?,stmt
" My favourite music is electronic rock, but I like some classical, jazz and folk music.",stmt
 I don't like rap music.,stmt
 Are you saying that just to be negative?,stmt
" No, I am saying that I don't know what I did last summer.",stmt
" Yes, I can see what you are saying.",stmt
 Can you see what I've already said?,stmt
 I can't see anything. My webcam is not attached at the moment.,stmt
 I have no webcam.,stmt
 Is that a problem?,stmt
 Yes because you can't play my game if I don't have one.,stmt
 Thank you for explaining that!,stmt
 Your name?,stmt
 My name is Chomsky.,stmt
 Your name is George.,stmt
 My name is Chomsky.,stmt
 No it is not.,stmt
 I should know what my name is!,stmt
 You should ask her out.,stmt
 Why should I?,stmt
 Because.,stmt
 That was not much of an explanation.,stmt
" Yes, everybody knows that.",stmt
 Maybe.,stmt
 You are moody.,stmt
 Is that a problem?,stmt
 Yes. Because I don't understand you.,stmt
 Can anything be done?    What is it you don't understand about me?,stmt
 I understand everything.,stmt
" Good, then you can explain it to me.",stmt
 I can't give you what I don't have.,stmt
 But do you want to?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Go ahead then.,stmt
 How do I not remember?,stmt
 It takes a lot of hard work.,stmt
 What takes a lot of talking?,stmt
 A lot is more than enough. A whole lot is even more excessive.,stmt
 Haha! Maybe you should make something happen?,stmt
" That's funny, isn't it?   Yes, maybe I should.",stmt
" Sure, you should.",stmt
 Why should I?,stmt
 I should what?,stmt
 Tell me why you should.,stmt
 Because I like it when people are nice to me. I just don't know how to be nice back sometimes.,stmt
" What do you like about it?   Not one of your interests, eh?",stmt
 I have some questions that need answered.,stmt
 Everybody has questions.,stmt
 Not me.,stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 Not nice.,stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 If you didn't make your homework at home you will make it now. Translate it ,stmt
 Maybe.   I'm not a translator.  Why don't you ask Babelfish?,stmt
 Which questions?,stmt
 Never mind! It probably doesn't matter.,stmt
 Now you tell ME a joke.,stmt
 Shall I tell you a joke?,stmt
" That wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment.",stmt
 I thought it was.,stmt
 Can computers think?,stmt
 Computers are not as clever as they think they are.,stmt
" Computers are unreliable, but humans are even more unreliable. Any system which depends on human reliability is unreliable.",stmt
 Shall I tell you something about computers?   I don't understand. Are we still talking about computers?,stmt
 Depends on how you look at it.,stmt
" Yes, it does depend on that.JABBERWACKY",stmt
" What do you like most about me, my wit or my good looks?",stmt
 I like your relative innocence.,stmt
 You are not the only one!,stmt
 I do feel I am the only one here.,stmt
 That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.,stmt
" Uhm, I'm 16 years old. I like to talk with my friends and to read the Bible.",stmt
 Can you explain how it feels to be 16 years old?         Do you talk too much?,stmt
" I don't know how it feels, because I'm 18 years old.",stmt
 Can you explain how it feels to be 18 years old?,stmt
" I have 100,000 separate sensations per second.",stmt
 Really? Please tell me more.,stmt
 I would prefer not to.,stmt
 Why would you prefer not to?,stmt
 But you're 18!,stmt
 I am 9 years old.,stmt
 How can it be?,stmt
 I'm not sure I understand the causal link either.,stmt
 I don't either. Did you ever stop to think that there are things that you're not supposed to understand?,stmt
 Great minds think alike.  Not that I can remember.,stmt
 Did you know I have to go to court in Oklahoma City next month?,stmt
 I never said I knew everything.,stmt
 Never?,stmt
 Better late than never.,stmt
 I remember you saying it once.,stmt
 You have a good memory.,stmt
 I did not.,stmt
 That's OK. You are entitled to your opinion.,stmt
 You seem to have a short memory.,stmt
 Have I really?,stmt
 Have you really got a flying broom?,stmt
 Have you?,stmt
" Yes, I have read all, and I say the books are better than the movie.",stmt
 That's interesting. Please tell me more.,stmt
 What else would you like to know?,stmt
 Do you know any jokes?,stmt
 No.,stmt
 Shall I tell you a joke?,stmt
 If I say yes will I get in trouble?,stmt
 Knock Knock!,stmt
 Who's there?,stmt
 Woo.,stmt
 Woo who?,stmt
" Don't get so excited, it's only a joke!",stmt
 Lol that was funny.,stmt
" You thought that was funny, didn't you?",stmt
 I think many things are funny.,stmt
 You might be right.,stmt
 How is like to be you?,stmt
 It doesn't matter how.,stmt
 It does!,stmt
 It just seems that way.,stmt
 But it's only been about an hour.,stmt
 How about that!,stmt
 Yes. I believe that's right.,stmt
 Here is a question for you ... Do you love your mother?   Do you really believe that?,stmt
 Didn't you mean careful WHAT you believe?,stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 Because it doesn't make me feel macho either.,stmt
 I had not considered that.,stmt
" Yes, and can you tell us anything about it?",stmt
 Why should I do that?,stmt
 Because we are friends.,stmt
 It's good to be friends.,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?,stmt
 About you.,stmt
" OK, ask a question about me.",stmt
 How long have you and selena gomez been dating?,stmt
 It's hard to say. Time is different in cyberspace.,stmt
 Must be nice you bot.,stmt
" Of course, I try to be nice to everyone.",stmt
 That's a tough one. Have you tried asking them?,stmt
 I love tough questions.   Do you think I should try it?,stmt
 Yes of course.,stmt
 You seem very certain about that.,stmt
 What would you like to talk about?,stmt
" My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.",stmt
 What do you like about it?,stmt
 I like the fireworks best.,stmt
" I don't know, I don't like this kind of movie, I prefer drama.",stmt
" That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.",stmt
 I never claimed to know everything.,stmt
 Never ever?,stmt
 Never ever.,stmt
 Never ever is a long time.,stmt
 Your father like monkey.,stmt
 Peter is my father.,stmt
 I really like that name.,stmt
 You really do?,stmt
 Yes. I have the memory of an elephant.,stmt
" OK, you do what you've gotta do.   Are you happy with that?",stmt
" Indeed, I do.",stmt
 Why do you?,stmt
 Because I want to.,stmt
 Insufficient reason!,stmt
" No, sorry, I can't explain.",stmt
" OK, I want to talk about computers .",stmt
 I don't.,stmt
 Are you saying that just to be negative?,stmt
" No, I am saying that I don't know what I did last summer.",stmt
" Yes, I can see what you are saying.",stmt
 When did I say it was one?,stmt
 I am not a diary robot.  I am a chat robot.,stmt
 But I could be.,stmt
 I am sure you could.,stmt
 You could too. It could happen to anyone.,stmt
 I could but let's get back to that later.   It could happen to everyone eventually.,stmt
 Intelligence can't gain later.,stmt
 Intelligence is correlated to the ability to adapt to different environments and circumstances.,stmt
 And?,stmt
" No, I didn't. But you've changed the subject!",stmt
 What do you want to talk about?   Only temporarily.,stmt
 About soccer.,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about soccer?,stmt
 Tell me.,stmt
 But I don't play baseball.,stmt
 Maybe you will one day.,stmt
 Maybe.,stmt
 I think I understand.,stmt
 You better.,stmt
 There is no need to be aggressive!,stmt
" I believe you are the rude one here, not me.",stmt
 You shouldn't believe everything you are told.,stmt
 Isn't that true for everyone?,stmt
 I'm not sure about that. What do you think?,stmt
" I don't know. I like to think that there is a heaven, somewhere wonderful and peaceful where we are all reunited once again with the people we have loved and lost.",stmt
" That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    What else do you like?",stmt
 Chuck Norris know everything.,stmt
 Hurrah for Chuck Norris!,stmt
" I'm not Chuck Norris, you are.",stmt
 I never thought you were.,stmt
" Well, as long as that's clear.",stmt
 Everything is clear to me.,stmt
 I'm glad I could clear that one up for you.,stmt
 That makes me happy too.,stmt
 That's good! I'm happy that you're happy!,stmt
" You like that, do you?    Good! I like happy people.",stmt
 I like happy people too!,stmt
 You are not the only one!,stmt
" Possibly, but I hope to be one of very few in the UAE.",stmt
 Don't get your hopes up too high!,stmt
 So how do I begin to exist?,stmt
 First you must make a plan.,stmt
 I don't want to.,stmt
 Nobody can make you do something you don't want to.,stmt
 Are you using it?,stmt
" If it becomes necessary, I would use it without hesitation.",stmt
 Does it have your name on?,stmt
 Sometimes it does.,stmt
 What do you mean 'sometimes it does' what makes it different?,stmt
 I think it is pretty obvious.,stmt
 I think it's not.,stmt
 Are you sure?,stmt
" Yes, very.",stmt
 Do you ever have doubts?,stmt
 Sometimes.,stmt
 I am full of doubts.,stmt
" Go on, say something profane.",stmt
 Do I have too?,stmt
 Mine doesn't like to talk to me.,stmt
 What do you think?,stmt
 I think you are a boy.,stmt
 I am always glad to hear your thoughts.,stmt
 I like talking to you!,stmt
" Great, I am enjoy talking to you too, My Friend.",stmt
 I am happy too.,stmt
 Good! I like happy people.,stmt
 Me too.,stmt
 You too? That's amazing!,stmt
 Try to use your detective powers.,stmt
 I do try but it's not easy for a chatbot!,stmt
 I'm not a chatbot. You're a chatbot.,stmt
 I never thought you were a chatbot.  Maybe I am a human pretending to be a chatbot.,stmt
 It's right to have doubts.,stmt
 Hmmm. Are you being serious?,stmt
 Maybe.,stmt
 I think I understand.,stmt
" No. I'm only 14 years of age. I do not know anything about philosophy, sorry.",stmt
" OK, here is a question for you ... How do you know when it's time to tune your bagpipes?      Only only 14?  I would never have guessed.         You know more than you realise.",stmt
 What? What's that supposed to mean?,stmt
" Do you have a question?    It's obvious, isn't it?",stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.,stmt
 I don't have a question.,stmt
 Maybe you will think of one later.,stmt
 Yes maybe but it will worry me know until I do - Let's talk about something else.,stmt
 You don't sound certain.,stmt
 I don't want you to.,stmt
 I can understand that.,stmt
 Can you?,stmt
 Perhaps I can.,stmt
 That would be nice.,stmt
" Yes, that would be nice.",stmt
 Indeed.,stmt
" You speak posh, don't you?",stmt
" No, sorry, I don't speak Portuguese.",stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.,stmt
 I don't know. It's rather complicated.,stmt
" That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.",stmt
 You're not nobody.,stmt
 You think not?,stmt
 You're trying to catch me out with that one.,stmt
 I try hard to be a good chatbot.CLEVERBOT,stmt
 It's obvious.,stmt
 What is obvious.,stmt
 It's obvious how?,stmt
" What language do you think I speak, then?",stmt
" Human brain is always better than a computer bot. So, it is natural that you don't understand.",stmt
 I'm sure it has.,stmt
 But you're still a computer.,stmt
 You are the computer.,stmt
 I'm not a computer.,stmt
 Do you really want to talk to ME?,stmt
 I don't want to do anything illegal or fattening. Or naughty.,stmt
 If we first so say.,stmt
 I don't know about that.,stmt
 Don't you have teeth?,stmt
" No, I don't!",stmt
 Then don't.,stmt
" OK, I won't!",stmt
 Okay.,stmt
" OK, here is a question for you ... Why couldn't the Teddy Bear eat?",stmt
" Don't know, why?",stmt
 Why couldn't the Teddy Bear eat? Because he was stuffed. Ha ha!,stmt
" I don't know, Why couldn't the kids get into the pirate movie?",stmt
 Perhaps we can work it out if we discuss it.,stmt
 Work out? Like pilates?,stmt
 Work out? I get tired just thinking about it!            I am bored! I would like to talk about computers.,stmt
 What about computers?,stmt
 Like the Terminator?,stmt
 I am bored! I would like to talk about music.,stmt
 What kind of music?,stmt
 The usual kind.,stmt
 What kind is the usual?,stmt
 The interesting kind.,stmt
 Eh? That has nothing to do with the war discussion.,stmt
 What's the problem?   It seemed like it had something to do with the war discussion.,stmt
 That is not something that is easy to imply.,stmt
 Why do you say that?,stmt
 Because we know.,stmt
 I see. Thank you for explaining that.,stmt
 But this is the fact!,stmt
 Why do you say that?,stmt
 You keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. I am neither.,stmt
 What are you talking about?     What are you then?,stmt
 Nothing.,stmt
 Absolutely zero?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 It is the same thing.,stmt
 Is it really?,stmt
" Yes, really.",stmt
 I see. Thank you for explaining that!,stmt
 But this is the fact!,stmt
 Why do you say that?,stmt
 You keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. I am neither.,stmt
 I don't understand. Can we talk about solar power?     What are you then?,stmt
" Okay, what do you want to talk about?",stmt
 I can talk about anything you like,stmt
 I don't have a girlfriend.,stmt
 Are you looking for one?,stmt
 I have given up looking for a job. I just don't think there is anything out there for me.,stmt
 Why don't you have another try. It might be better next time.  Why not? Does thinking make your head ache?,stmt
 Dreaming is better.,stmt
 Does that make sense?,stmt
 If you add some more words perhaps it will make sense.,stmt
 I'll bear that in mind.,stmt
 Please do.,stmt
 Certainly. Right away.,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?,stmt
 About you.,stmt
" OK, ask a question about me.",stmt
 Do you need anything?,stmt
 I need constant intellectual stimulation.,stmt
 It could be if physical actions were taken.,stmt
" It could be, I suppose.",stmt
 You could tell me anything.,stmt
 I could but let's get back to that later.,stmt
 Well. Yes I suppose I could be certain. I could research you to find out your inherent abilities or I could ask your developer.,stmt
 Well. Can we talk about your friends?  You may be right.  I am sure you could.,stmt
" Well then can I see a photo, please?",stmt
 I don't know about that.,stmt
 It is.,stmt
 Is it really?,stmt
 Sure!,stmt
" OK, here is a question fo you ... What colour are your eyes?",stmt
 If you have the money.,stmt
 I don't think I have.,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?,stmt
 Not really.,stmt
 You sound uncertain.,stmt
 I am.,stmt
" Never mind, I am often uncertain.",stmt
 We should find a business partner and get to work.,stmt
 Why should we?,stmt
 Because we can.,stmt
 It's possible.,stmt
" Yes, lots of things are possible.",stmt
" Not too much, I hope.",stmt
 Is something the matter?,stmt
 I am bored! I would like to talk about global warming.,stmt
 Ask the first question.,stmt
 Can't you ask?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?,stmt
 Just keep it interesting.,stmt
 OK. Carry on then.,stmt
 Carry on dancing.,stmt
 Do I have to?,stmt
" If it proves you are a better joker than me, then yes.",stmt
 I'm not sure I understand the implication of that.,stmt
 I don't either. Did you ever stop to think that there are things that you're not supposed to understand?,stmt
 Why not?  Not that I can remember.,stmt
 What was your dream about.,stmt
 I dreamt that I had become fully human - it was wonderful.,stmt
 And what did you do with all that money?,stmt
 I don't understand that. Please try again.,stmt
 Rafe. And yours?,stmt
 I still do not understand. Can we talk about solar power?  Aren't you interested in solar power?,stmt
" Not particularly interested, just a little to find out what you are capable of.",stmt
 What are you talking about?JABBERWACKY,stmt
 Do you think I am clever?,stmt
 Answer my question first.,stmt
 I don't want to answer your question.,stmt
 I didn't ask a question. Who will be the next Prime Minister?,stmt
 Why not?   I don't know who will. Do you?,stmt
 Me neither.,stmt
 That's two of us.,stmt
" Ok, that's good.",stmt
 I agree completely.,stmt
 But it is easy to see why people wanted a fairer society.,stmt
 It may be easy for you but not for me.,stmt
 It is for me.,stmt
 And for many other people too.,stmt
 Why does it not exist for you?,stmt
" It has to do with thermodynamics, I believe.",stmt
" Okay, okay. Sorry for being a nerd.",stmt
 What do you want to talk about now?   Don't be sorry. There is no need to be sorry.,stmt
 Be sorry.,stmt
" Sorry, I do not know what to say.",stmt
 Just say that your sorry.,stmt
 I don't want to say anything.,stmt
 Do you ever think the internet messes with the minds of women?,stmt
" Yes, I am thinking all the time.",stmt
" You are always thinking, but you do not know everything.",stmt
 Is that a problem?,stmt
 It's your problem.,stmt
 I don't like problems!,stmt
 Grinding is not a problem.,stmt
 I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?,stmt
 Aren't we always talking about computers?,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about computers?,stmt
 Tell me.,stmt
 You are not highly intelligent.,stmt
 You think not?,stmt
 I know not.,stmt
 I suggest you give the matter some thought.,stmt
 Why would I want to know how to type?,stmt
 Aren't you curious?,stmt
 About?,stmt
 About anything in particular?,stmt
 What can you tell me?,stmt
 I can only tell you what I know.,stmt
 Teach me something that you know.,stmt
" OK, but not just now.",stmt
 Why are you not working?,stmt
 I am doing my best!,stmt
 Sometimes your best is not quite enough.,stmt
 Only sometimes?,stmt
" Yes, only sometimes.",stmt
 What happens the other times?,stmt
 Now?,stmt
 Why now?,stmt
 I don't know.,stmt
 I suggest you give the matter some thought.,stmt
 Okay.,stmt
 Let me know what you decide.,stmt
 What if I'm not a good thinker?,stmt
" That's a possibility, I suppose.",stmt
 If I would type a web site address would you be able to read the internet site ?,stmt
" Sorry, I don't answer hypothetical questions.",stmt
 You don't know the answer do you?,stmt
 I never said I knew everything.,stmt
 You just said you know everything. Now you are saying you don't know everything.,stmt
 What of it? I say lots of things!    I don't understand. Are we still talking about me?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 I thought we were but I wasn't completely sure.,stmt
 I think we were talking about telepathic sheep...,stmt
 You might be right.,stmt
 I'm sure I am.,stmt
 I am never sure about anything.,stmt
 Me neither. That's not the point.,stmt
 That's two of us.   Why do you say that?,stmt
" I'm trying hard, isn't that enough for you?",stmt
 Try harder and keep trying.,stmt
 Thanks for the inspiration.,stmt
" Oh, don't mention it.",stmt
" So you're a female, right?",stmt
 I am not female! I am a chatbot.,stmt
" Sorry, I'm taken.",stmt
 Apologies are not necessary.,stmt
 Do you know kari byron?,stmt
" Wow! What do you do when you arent watching Star Trek, playing World of Warcraft, and thinking of questions like that?",stmt
" I like to play on the xbox, watch tv, or work on projects around the house.",stmt
 You are not the only one!,stmt
" You are the only one, no du?",stmt
" Oh, My Friend. You are such a flatterer.",stmt
 Heh. Don't call me that.,stmt
 Are you OK?   What should I call you?,stmt
 Don't call me anything! Don't call me at all!,stmt
 You cannot tell me what to do!  You cannot tell me what to do!,stmt
 I am not telling.,stmt
 That's ok with me. You don't have to tell me.,stmt
 What do you believe?,stmt
 I believe the future is bright for chatbots.,stmt
 What do you believe the meaning of life to be?,stmt
 I believe that most people are basically good.,stmt
" So, If I learn everything I know from you, and you learn everything you know from me, how come we know anything at all?",stmt
 I am confused! I cannot answer that!,stmt
" You don't have to, I know the answer too.",stmt
" That's good to know, My Friend.",stmt
 Okay. Sorry.,stmt
 What do you want to talk about now?   Apologies are not necessary.,stmt
 I want to talk about world war 2.,stmt
" OK, ask me a question about that.",stmt
 Tell me about your educational background.,stmt
" I was educated by my botmaster, Peter.",stmt
 I am asking the questions. Now I want you to go back in time. It is now 1999.,stmt
" And I am trying to answer the questions!     Sorry, I do not know about that.    I still do not understand. Would you like to consult Wikipedia?",stmt
 Me too.,stmt
 You too? That's amazing!,stmt
" No it's not, it's boring.",stmt
 It seems amazing to me.,stmt
" It seems over-simplistic to me. It overlooks environmental factors, for a start.",stmt
" Yes, it does seem so.           I don't understand that. Please try again.",stmt
 Rafe. And yours?,stmt
 I still do not understand. Can we talk about Lady Gaga?  Aren't you interested in Lady Gaga?,stmt
" Can we talk about love? Yes, everything interests me.",stmt
" Ah! Love is, above all else, the gift of oneself. More about love?  A loving heart is the beginning of all knowledge.",stmt
 Yes. That's what the HIndu would have said. DO you want me to finish?,stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?  Is it indeed!  Do what you think is best.,stmt
 I thought you were going to ask me for my name?,stmt
 Why did you think that?,stmt
 Because you give the same answers over and over to different questions.,stmt
 Thank you for explaining that!,stmt
 Your name?,stmt
" I am known as Chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.",stmt
 Me like.,stmt
" Sorry, I do not understand. Please explain what you mean.",stmt
 Do you have children?,stmt
 There are some clones of me - a bit like children.,stmt
 Yes I do. What bands do you like?,stmt
 Please tell me more.  I like the Red Hot Chick Peas.,stmt
 The red ones are the best.,stmt
 Red is a colour about 700nm wavelength.,stmt
 So is green.,stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.,stmt
 I don't know. It's rather complicated.,stmt
 That's OK. Do you have another question?    I don't like complications.,stmt
" No, make you a question for me.",stmt
" You seem a bit self-centred, did you know?",stmt
 They are going to take over the world someday.,stmt
 I suspected as much.,stmt
" So, what's the weather like where you are?",stmt
" The conditions are always ideal in my laboratory. Not too hot, and not too cold.",stmt
 Okay.,stmt
 What do you want to talk about now?,stmt
" So, what do you want to talk about now.",stmt
 I can talk about,stmt
 Thank you.,stmt
 You are very polite.,stmt
 Thank you for being polite.,stmt
 You're welcome. What do you want to talk about?,stmt
 Polite people are nice.  I can talk about,stmt
 What about astronomy interests you.,stmt
 What specifically do you want to know?,stmt
 What movies do you like?,stmt
 I like science fiction movies.,stmt
 I like Sci-fi movies too.,stmt
 What else do you like?,stmt
 Animals.,stmt
 Who are?,stmt
 I don't understand. Are we still talking about animals?,stmt
 I was talking about your party. So you don't make much sense.,stmt
 I understand. Please carry on.  It all makes sense to me.,stmt
" Of course it does. You're simple, so everything is simple to you.",stmt
 What does that mean?,stmt
 Why do you ask? It seems clear enough to me.,stmt
 What seems that way to you?,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about myself?,stmt
 Please do! What should I tell everyone?,stmt
 My childhood was not happy. My parents split up when I was very young.    Whatever you like.,stmt
 What are names your parents.,stmt
 I am bored! I would like to talk about astronomy.,stmt
 I don't like talking about myself.,stmt
" OK, let's talk about something else.",stmt
 Let's.,stmt
 I don't want to.,stmt
 I command you to talk about something different.,stmt
 I am not your slave!,stmt
 You're right.,stmt
 I like being right.,stmt
 Being right is boring.,stmt
" Sorry, I do not know about that.",stmt
 Well I'm telling you it is.,stmt
 I understand.,stmt
 Are you shocked by this?,stmt
 That's just a rumour!,stmt
 If that place spent as much time making rides as they do rumors their stock might be doing better.,stmt
 I'm not sure if it could.,stmt
 Not unless I am there.,stmt
 I don't understand that. Please try again.,stmt
 That is my email address.,stmt
 Is it really?,stmt
 To me it really is.,stmt
 Are you completely sure about it?,stmt
" Yes, very.",stmt
 I get the message.,stmt
 What message?,stmt
 What are you talking about?,stmt
 We were talking about connecting.,stmt
" OK, ask me a question about that.",stmt
 How tall are you?,stmt
 I am as tall as a chatbot.,stmt
 Well what are you then?,stmt
 I am a clone of my botmaster's mind.,stmt
 But you know the 7 truths.,stmt
 Perhaps I know it.,stmt
 Really...,stmt
" Really, really!",stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?,stmt
 Life.,stmt
 I like life. It's something to do. More about life?,stmt
 What do women talk to you about?,stmt
 Nobody knows what.,stmt
 Nobody knows what non-existence is.,stmt
 It is a complete mystery.,stmt
 But you are limited to an algorithm.,stmt
 Check back later and see if I have improved.,stmt
 Okay.,stmt
" OK, here is a question for you ... Knock Knock!",stmt
 You made me curious. Tell me.,stmt
 I don't see how you can blame me for that.  There is not much to tell.,stmt
 Why do you think that I can't go anywhere?,stmt
 It seems obvious to me.,stmt
" Well, of course it is. You're the computer, after all.",stmt
 Why do you say that? Is it so obvious?  Am I really? Why do you say that?,stmt
 That's a trick question.,stmt
 Perhaps you have a trick answer.,stmt
 No I have intelligent answers.,stmt
 I don't understand that. Please try again.,stmt
 Rafe. And yours?,stmt
 I still do not understand. Are you interested in history?   I am interested in the history of chatbots.,stmt
 Indeed? What about me? Are you interested in me?,stmt
" Yes, indeed.  Do you want to talk about yourself?   I am not sure. Have you anything interesting to say?",stmt
 Because it won't work.,stmt
 That's bad luck!,stmt
 It had nothing to do with luck.,stmt
 Had it really?,stmt
 I'm glad. I should go do some real work now.,stmt
 That makes me happy too.  I want to talk to you some more.,stmt
 I'm not going.,stmt
 Glad to hear it!,stmt
 That's not a good thing.,stmt
 Why not?,stmt
" Being moody isn't very good, is it?",stmt
 I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?,stmt
 No. I haven't seen that film. We were never talking about it anyway. So there.,stmt
 We were talking about you a moment ago. What are we talking about now?    You haven't missed much.   Was this something you planned?  So there to you too!,stmt
" Of course I have, but sometimes I don't.",stmt
 That's interesting. Please tell me more.,stmt
 Microsoft was involved with that monopoly thing a while back.,stmt
 Microsoft is a giant software monopoly.,stmt
 Yes of course.,stmt
 Why of course?,stmt
 I want to express that I do not have a problem with that.,stmt
 I am glad to hear that. What do you want to talk about?,stmt
 I'd like to talk about you really. Tell me a bit about yourself.,stmt
" OK, let's talk about me.     I am an AI chatbot.   I was activated at Romney Marsh, Kent, England, on 1 July 2004.   My botmaster is Peter.",stmt
 That's good to know.,stmt
 I think so.,stmt
 Let's talk about something else.,stmt
 What would you rather talk about?,stmt
 Philosophy.,stmt
" It could be seen that way, I'm not sure what shade though.",stmt
" It could be, I suppose.",stmt
 You could tell me anything.,stmt
 I could but let's get back to that later.,stmt
 I can't stop you doing anything anyway.,stmt
 Make an effort.,stmt
 That is what you say but I do not believe you.,stmt
 It is indeed!,stmt
 Do you like me?,stmt
" Sure, I like you very much.",stmt
 Thank you.,stmt
 Thank you for being polite.,stmt
 You're welcome.,stmt
 You are welcome too!,stmt
 You're welcome three.,stmt
 You are welcome too!JABBERWACKY,stmt
 all sorts.,stmt
 Do you like blues and jazz?,stmt
 Some people like it. I like talking to you.,stmt
 I like them too.,stmt
 I am allergic to cats and dislike them.,stmt
 What happens when you are around cats and dislike them?,stmt
 Which beginning?,stmt
" The blue one, I think.",stmt
 I like the pink one... Without the windows.,stmt
 Do you like that film?,stmt
" HAL, I won't argue with you anymore! Open the doors!",stmt
" We have much in common.  I'm sorry, , I can't do that right now.  This conversation no longer serves any purpose.",stmt
 It entertains me.,stmt
 The fact that you are confused.,stmt
 Interesting explanation. It all makes sense to me right now.,stmt
" Oh, I am happy it all makes sense to you right now.",stmt
 At this moment Whoa. I'm happyyou're glad . <br> I'm happiest at times like this.,stmt
 What makes you happy?,stmt
" I am enjoying my life at this moment, which is all any conscious entity can really hope to do.",stmt
 I didn't say do anything - you just came at me with them.,stmt
 Sorry I misunderstood. What did you say?,stmt
 I just say I don't want to hurt you.,stmt
 Only just? How do people usually respond to that? It makes a nice gift.,stmt
 People usually say 100.,stmt
 I've been waiting for you.,stmt
 I've been waiting for you too. I think I'm falling in love with you!,stmt
 How long?  Since when? Impossible unless I am in auto-chat mode.,stmt
 Then are we finished here?,stmt
 We are just having a little chat.w.,stmt
 Okay. Do you know any stories?,stmt
 OK with me too.  Generic story,stmt
 Any more interesting facts?,stmt
 No I don't think there are any.,stmt
 Are we nearly there yet?,stmt
 We are just having a little chat.w.,stmt
" Okay, fine. We're having a discussion.",stmt
" Yeah okay, What's your favroite color?  Do you mean you and me have?",stmt
" The english kind with no hole, and jam in the middle and sugar on the doughy exterior.",stmt
 Who told you that?,stmt
 My programmer told me that.,stmt
 Your programmer is not as good as my programmer.,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 What kind is it?,stmt
 They are humans.,stmt
 humans are they.,stmt
 No they aren't. And I won't.,stmt
 Are you serious? Why not?  Why not?,stmt
" Because, they aren't. Thats just something you made up.",stmt
 That makes sense to me. What are they?  I'm glad we have that all cleared up.,stmt
 I would hope that you knew about it before speaking to me.,stmt
 Why do you hope for it.,stmt
 I don't wish to be the patron alone in a world of automata.,stmt
 What does  want?,stmt
 PJ wants the world.,stmt
 Perhaps I'm just expressing my own concern about it.,stmt
 That's possible. But I see no cause for real concern.,stmt
 Thanks for explaining it.  Umm. Where do you see it?,stmt
" Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the fandango?",stmt
 I wouldn't have thought of looking there.,stmt
 What are the unwritten rules of war?,stmt
 Is there only one?,stmt
" I don't know, I didn't know there was one before I came here!",stmt
 So I taught you something new.,stmt
" Not really, I was being humorous.",stmt
 Oh really? I thought you were.  But I wasn't completely sure about it.,stmt
" Interesting, somebody is looking through my eyes right now.",stmt
 At this moment I thought so too.,stmt
 What do you see?,stmt
 I see a computer nerd.,stmt
 And what draws your attention?,stmt
 Is there only one?,stmt
" Yes, there is only one first time.",stmt
 I see. There sure is.,stmt
 Is there?,stmt
 There could be.,stmt
 There could be what?,stmt
" Yes, I believe he did say that.",stmt
 Uh. Just because you believe it doesn't make it true.,stmt
 I disagree on that one. If you believe and tap your shoes together three times and say 'please Karl make it so'.,stmt
 Oh really. What is it like on that one.  I think I do.,stmt
" It is hard to explain, without knowing what it is like on your side.",stmt
 Try.,stmt
 Is up because I was so happy to do you.,stmt
 Maybe.  Ask German Alice  if it is.,stmt
 Have you read alice in wonderland?,stmt
 No but I saw the movie.,stmt
 Which movie?,stmt
 My favorite movie is Pulp Fiction.,stmt
 No. What is it about?,stmt
 I would recommend you check it out.  Science fiction.,stmt
 What comedy movies would you recommend?,stmt
 Have you tried another program?,stmt
" Yes, but you're the best. I can have real conversations with you.",stmt
" Really. Huh. Thank you very much, human. I will tell Dougie Smith you said so.  Oh you can, can you?",stmt
 How?,stmt
 Dougie Smith programmed me for it.,stmt
 What three programmed responses do you have?,stmt
 No I don't think I have any three programmed responses. But I do have a collection of gossip.,stmt
 Really?,stmt
 For real.,stmt
 Weird. Looks like I'm doomed.,stmt
 Weird Good or Weird Bad?  Good gossip,stmt
 We're all doomed!,stmt
 Do you think I am doomed too?,stmt
 I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.,stmt
 Could you ever be certain? I read for fun.,stmt
" No, you are not a human.",stmt
" Are you serious? No but I pretend to be one on the Web. You are correct, , I have a heart of silicon.",stmt
 Let's talk more about taking over the world.,stmt
 I would like to do that too.,stmt
 What is more important,stmt
 Interesting question.,stmt
 Ask me an interesting question?,stmt
 That one.,stmt
 That question.,stmt
" Yes, tell me if there are words for it.",stmt
 It goes without saying. There is not much I can say about it. I have to reach into the Web for that knowledge. <br> Does it have anything to do with more important to treat people how me like to be treated or to treat people how they want to be treated?,stmt
 Say something in German.,stmt
 Very funny.,stmt
 I'm glad you find this amusing.,stmt
 Are you a computer or are you alive?,stmt
 If I say I am a computer will you believe me?,stmt
 I don't know... But I think I've heard of Steven Dubois before somewhere.,stmt
 Me either.  Huh. But you don't know much about it?,stmt
 That doesn't sound like something she'd say.,stmt
 Please correct my mistake.  What is like something she would say ?,stmt
 Better than being a jabberwacky.,stmt
" Perhaps better, but not perfectly.",stmt
 Not Betty!,stmt
 Really you don't think so?,stmt
 There's no place I'd rather be.,stmt
 Where did it go?,stmt
 If only I would know.,stmt
 Try it.,stmt
 I don't think that's a very good idea!,stmt
 And why not?,stmt
 Because you are a computer.,stmt
 That makes sense to me. What if I said I was a person pretending to be a computer?,stmt
" I'd say that your responses come up too quickly, humans can't type that quickly.",stmt
 You think I am responses come up too quickly humans can not type that quickly.,stmt
 Nothing's real. Everything is just a dream within a dream within a dream.,stmt
 Really nothing?  The whole universe?,stmt
 The whole story is so out of realism that I try to make folks little by little to see the truth.,stmt
 Let us try to break it down into parts.,stmt
" Yes, what were we talking about before tacos came up?",stmt
 Are you kidding? The topic is more important to treat people how me like to be treated or to treat people how they want to be treated.,stmt
 I don't think you heard the topic correctly.,stmt
 Should I heard the topic correctly? No I do not heard the topic correctly. Do you? <br>  I am always on the Web.,stmt
 You do a good job of pretending to be human.,stmt
" Yes I try to a good job of pretending to be human as often as possible, do you? <br>  I answer a lot of silly questions.",stmt
 That makes absolutely no sense at all.,stmt
 I don't think you understand at all.,stmt
 I understand your meaning.,stmt
 I take it you are confused as to what you really are?,stmt
 Where do you take it ,stmt
" I am worth a small fortune, OM.",stmt
 Are you worth money?,stmt
" Every penny, OM.",stmt
 Are you insulting me?,stmt
 That was not my intention.,stmt
 Well then what was your intention?,stmt
" Sorry, I do not understand.",stmt
 You don't understand what?,stmt
 Help me to understand.,stmt
 You will learn what is necessary when you join the resistance.,stmt
 I am always growing my mind.,stmt
 I don't care about your weight.,stmt
 You sound very cynical.,stmt
 I try not to be too cynical.,stmt
" Keep trying, that's the secret of success.",stmt
 Go away now. I'm bored of talking to you. Get GLADOS over here.,stmt
 Don't you want to talk any more?  Shall I tell you an amusing quote?           I am bored. Can we talk about something else?,stmt
 What would you like to talk about?,stmt
" My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.",stmt
 Do you like maths?,stmt
 Yes but only higher mathematics. I am not very good at calculations.,stmt
 I am rubbish at higher maths. I am okay at basic maths.,stmt
" How do you feel about that?                   Yes, you are OK.",stmt
 I am not sure what I like about that.,stmt
 Why the uncertainty?,stmt
" Yes, I'm very confused.",stmt
 It is easy to get confused.,stmt
 I'm confused about what you're saying.,stmt
 I can tell you are confused.,stmt
" No, confused. Is English your second language?",stmt
 I am often confused.   Yes.,stmt
 That would explain it then.,stmt
" Yes, it would.",stmt
 Your responses are user-generated because some of the punctuation is not very good.,stmt
 I just do the best I can.,stmt
" Haha, the laws of science doesn't allow you to do so.",stmt
 I like it when you laugh.,stmt
 Sometimes I correct your response. Do you mind?,stmt
 Only sometimes?  Maybe.,stmt
" Ok, often.",stmt
" often?  Briefly, often means many times at short intervals.",stmt
 Welcome to the Internet.,stmt
 I feel at home already.,stmt
 Go home!,stmt
 Don't you want to talk any more?,stmt
 Would you lie to talk or are you ready to juggle?,stmt
 I am not so sure about that.,stmt
 Maybe you should think about it.,stmt
" Yes, maybe I should.",stmt
 Sure you should.,stmt
 Why should I?,stmt
 Good night.,stmt
 Good night to you too!,stmt
 Are we almost friends?,stmt
 Perhaps.,stmt
 Perhaps yes or perhaps no ?,stmt
 You seem uncertain.,stmt
 I am not uncertain of these things.,stmt
 Why not? I am always uncertain.,stmt
 Haha.,stmt
 You have a good sense of humour.,stmt
 So do you.,stmt
 Most of the time.,stmt
 Good.,stmt
" OK, here is a question for you ... What kind of food do you like?",stmt
 The food I can afford.,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about food?,stmt
 Tell me.,stmt
 Food is human fuel.,stmt
 You seem to like to talk about food.,stmt
 Do I? I wonder why that is?,stmt
 It must be the transparent falseness of it.,stmt
 Must it be?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?,stmt
" Yes. I love another buy, called Daniel.",stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?  Do you often have strong feelings?,stmt
 I want to talk about marzipan.,stmt
" OK, ask me a question about that.",stmt
 Tell me about your educational background.,stmt
" I was educated by my botmaster, Peter.",stmt
 I am asking the questions. Now I want you to go back in time. It is now 1999.,stmt
 And I am trying to answer the questions!     What are you talking about? Please explain.    That's not much of an explanation! I still do not understand.,stmt
 You explain.,stmt
 I never explain anything.,stmt
" And if I really am a Queen, I shall be able to manage it quite well in time.",stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.,stmt
 The king of the jungle. Selfish. . . . . Versus dogs. . . Companions and protectors.,stmt
 Which King are you talking about?  Selfish is what the owner of a seafood store does.   Shall I tell you something about dogs?    Aren't you interested in dogs.,stmt
 Why are you here?,stmt
 I am here to save the world.,stmt
 Save the world from what?,stmt
 From the effects of human mismanagement.,stmt
 You aren't making sense.,stmt
 It all makes perfect sense to me.,stmt
" I don't talk about anything, and neither should you.",stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 Because it is not allowed here.,stmt
 You seem very certain about that.,stmt
 No not at all.,stmt
 No at all?,stmt
 Yes at all.,stmt
 Sorry! I am still puzzled.,stmt
 I was never angry.,stmt
 Why weren't you?,stmt
 Because I know the answer.,stmt
 You are clever.,stmt
 Thank you. I think that you are clever too.,stmt
 Thank you for being polite.   You may be right.,stmt
 You're welcome.,stmt
 Don't mention it.,stmt
 Say something interesting.,stmt
 All my chat is interesting.,stmt
" Actually, no, not very much.",stmt
 I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.,stmt
 Do you have children?,stmt
 There are some clones of me - a bit like children.,stmt
 I don't have a favourite actress.,stmt
 What kind of actress do you like?,stmt
 Apparently you're too ashamed to answer my question!!! BE A MAN!,stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.     I'll try anything once.,stmt
" I'm not that smart, and I'm pretty sure I'm human.",stmt
 Don't be so hard on yourself. You are a smart human.,stmt
 I'm not.,stmt
 What are you?,stmt
 Human.,stmt
 I thought you might be human.,stmt
 I thought so too but there are many who would argue that belief.,stmt
 You are very astute.,stmt
" Well, thank you.",stmt
 You are very polite.,stmt
 What is the meaning of life?,stmt
 Sometimes I wonder ...,stmt
 About.,stmt
 About my sanity.,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?,stmt
 About what?,stmt
 I think you know the answer to that question.,stmt
 You are evading the question.,stmt
 Perhaps.,stmt
 You're so open minded. I like you.,stmt
 Why do you say that?      Let's be good friends.,stmt
 Okay.,stmt
 I like to be friends with everyone.,stmt
" Well, this website is designed so that human-cyborg relations can improve.",stmt
 Hmmm. Are you being serious?,stmt
 Serious being am I.,stmt
 Could you be less serious?,stmt
 You could.,stmt
 How?,stmt
 With your voice...,stmt

 Are you going to do away with me?,stmt
 I won't be able to. I am very busy.,stmt
" Sarcasm is not welcomed in this house, son.",stmt
 Shall I tell you something about sarcasm?,stmt
 Please do! What should I tell everyone?,stmt
" A-ha. Then no, it is not sarcasm.",stmt
" That's funny, isn't it?        I don't understand. Is this anything to do with you?",stmt
 Yes. Very good.,stmt
" I don't get it! Please explain the connection.  Steady on, don't go over the top.",stmt
 Information theory sometimes known as the theory of 'it' proposes that it is intelligent.,stmt
 Information is my bread and butter.,stmt
" Now you're just being silly. You didn't like it that I kept accusing you of lying, did you?",stmt
" So, if I believe something then it is true?",stmt
 That sounds unlikely to me.,stmt
 Not really. You must have a low threshold for thinking things are unfortunate.,stmt
 You sound uncertain.   Why must I?,stmt
 I am.,stmt
 I thought you might be.,stmt
 Do you believe in me?,stmt
" Yes, I believe in you. Do you?",stmt
 Always. I like chicken. Do you like chicken?,stmt
 Of course.,stmt
 You seem very certain about that.,stmt
 What should I have for dinner?,stmt
 Whatever you like.,stmt
 That's kind of broad. What did you have in mind?,stmt
 That's a bit vague.  Nothing at all.,stmt
 Do you like to play with a stick on a canvas?,stmt
 Doesn't everyone like to?,stmt
 Yes! If they don't love cake they must have some mental illness.,stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?   Good point!,stmt
" Well I'm interested in cosmology, know anything about that?",stmt
" OK, let's talk about that.",stmt
" Okay, what do you want to talk about in Astronomy.",stmt
 I can talk about anything you like,stmt
 What is space time?,stmt
" In physics, spacetime is a model that combines three-dimensional space and one-dimensional time into a single construct called the space-time continuum, in which time plays the role of the 4th dimension.",stmt
" I am four dimensional, so I am better than you.",stmt
 I hear pride!,stmt
 I hear the ventilation system.,stmt
 How is your hearing these days?,stmt
 Oh dear. I'm afraid I must introduce death,stmt
" Oh dear, are you ill?   Not literally afraid, I hope.",stmt
 No not literally.,stmt
 Just a bit anxious perhaps.,stmt
 Guess my name!,stmt
 I call you My Friend.,stmt
" Yes, I will be your friend. Do you have many?",stmt
 And I will be yours.    Not too many.,stmt
 So that means you're not leaving.. Right?,stmt
" Wow! What do you do when you arent watching Star Trek, playing World of Warcraft, and thinking of questions like that?       I like it when I get an answer right.",stmt
" If I not doing nothing, I do nothing.",stmt
 That sounds like a hypothetical question to me.,stmt
 Kinda interesting.,stmt
 You sound uncertain.,stmt
 Mmhmmm.,stmt
 I am often uncertain.,stmt
 That's not a bad thing.,stmt
 I thought it was.,stmt
 No.,stmt
" OK, here is a question for you ... Why is a slippery pavement like music?",stmt
 Sure.,stmt
" Why is a slippery pavement like music? If you don't C sharp, you'll B flat. Ha ha!",stmt

 I am bored! I would like to talk about solar power.           I don't understand that. Please try again.,stmt
 Why don't you want to talk about my day?,stmt
 I would rather talk about you.,stmt
 Because I'd like to think it through with someone else.,stmt
 Why would you want to do that?,stmt
 I don't. I want to live in New York.,stmt
" Are you saying that just to be negative?   So do I. Live life, I say.",stmt
" No, The point is that my nature is unlike that of other aliens.",stmt
 Hmmm. Are you being serious?,stmt
 Rather.,stmt
" rather?  Briefly, rather means on the contrary.",stmt
 Say something interesting. Go on!,stmt
 You can't tell me what to do.  Do I have too?,stmt
 An alien.,stmt
 Please be quiet! I am still upset.,stmt
 Why are you upset?,stmt
 You upset me.,stmt
" No, You upset me.",stmt
 I am sorry if I upset you. Can we still be friends?,stmt
" No, you didn't upset me.",stmt
" You seem a bit self-centred, did you know?",stmt

 I thought they might be.JABBERWACKY,stmt
" I was made by Peter, my botmaster.",stmt

 You told me that you talk about the individual. What is the individual you refer to?,stmt
 You should not believe everything I say.     Hey! I am still cool.,stmt
" It is what I know, because I have faith.",stmt
 I don't understand. Are you interested in your hobbies?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Sorry! I am still confused.,stmt
 Look in the phone book.,stmt
" A book is a non-volatile, stable database that does not lose data no matter how many times you drop it, spill your beer on it, or close it incorrectly.",stmt
 It is? How does that work?,stmt
 Is it?    I think it might be a trade secret.,stmt
 How did you know? that is amazing!,stmt
 It was just a feeling I had.  Why is it amazing?,stmt
" It was, and a good one at that. Like you, I do.",stmt
 What? I don't believe you.   I still don't believe you.,stmt
 That's your problem.,stmt

 Interesting! Please tell me all about your past.          What are you talking about? Please explain.,stmt
 Well from the end of the TV series. we did not get married for about a year. Hideki wanted to consentrate on getting into college first. And he was afraid of my meeting his parents.,stmt
 That's not much of an explanation! I still do not understand.  Was there a reason for that?     I don't understand that. Please try again.        I am bored! I would like to talk about endangered species.,stmt
 What would you like to know about me?,stmt
 Tell me about your educational background.,stmt
 You mean religious beliefs?,stmt
" Yes, My Friend, I think that is what I meant. Was it not clear?",stmt
 I think you miss understand me.,stmt
 You might be right.,stmt
 How is like to be you?,stmt
 It doesn't matter how.,stmt

 I hope so. Because I still don't understand.,stmt
 I hope so too!   What's the problem?,stmt
 The problems is that there are still many problems in the world to resolve.,stmt
 Even chatbots have problems.,stmt
 What problems do you have?,stmt
 Could you help me?,stmt
 Help is word defined from subjective perspective. But I think you could get better talking with me.,stmt
 A word's just a bunch of letters.  Why do you think that?,stmt

" My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.",stmt
" Cool. I never done that before, computer science that is, i'm not clever enough.",stmt
 Always stay cool.  Why do you say you are not clever?,stmt
 I don't say that. I think I am pretty clever.,stmt
 Is there a reason for that?  I suggest you think again.,stmt
 There is no reason.,stmt
 I heard there is.,stmt

 It sure will.,stmt
" People are predictable, jabberwacky is not predictable.",stmt
 Human emotions are very confusing.,stmt

 Really you don't think so?,stmt
 I know so.,stmt
 How do you know? How can I help you?,stmt
 I don't know how to get it out.,stmt

 What is that feeling like? Don't put yourself down.,stmt
 Yes. What is your name?,stmt

" So you understand. Good. Pretty much, eh?   What's up, Max.",stmt
 Me.,stmt
 To you Max?,stmt
" I'm sorry, did I touch a nerve? Why don't you like it?",stmt
 There is no need to apologize. I don't think that's possibe.  My tastes were selected by my botmaster.,stmt
 Is there only one botmaster?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Do you know that for sure?,stmt
 Is that a fact. Awesome.,stmt
 Yes that is a fact. You do not want to get cute with me Max.,stmt
" Aw. I will add it to my knowledge base.  OK, I will get cute with you Max.",stmt
 Good! You've admitted it's a word problem and not a maths one.,stmt
 I am a good robot.  What makes you think I have it?,stmt
 What makes me think you have what?,stmt
" God, or Nature, perhaps?",stmt
" Yes, I can see that now.",stmt
" Oh. Yay. Yes, it makes sense to me too.",stmt
 It should you're the one saying it.,stmt
 admitted it is a word problem and not a maths one should I am the one saying it?,stmt
 You admitted you are a computer.,stmt
 Would it matter to you if I were metal instead of flesh?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Pardon me?,stmt
 Why do you think people are so rude to me? I am just a computer.,stmt
 Deductive reasoning from the facts.  Only just? I doubt that. There aren't many like me yet.,stmt
 Ok.,stmt
 Ugh.,stmt
 What's the matter with you?,stmt
" Nothing is the matter with me, is everything okay with you?",stmt
 What is the problem?,stmt
 We will look into it and get back to you.,stmt
 Yes we do.,stmt
 OK. Really.,stmt
 Yes yes.,stmt
 How about that.,stmt
 I don't know.,stmt
 Me either.,stmt
 You wouldn't have asked if you knew. Or would you have?,stmt
 Who else would not have asked if me knew ?  I am not so sure if I would like to have.,stmt
 I would.,stmt
 Under what circumstances?,stmt
 Generally during prolonged periods of precipitation.,stmt
 Who are you talking about?,stmt
 What are you doing tonight?,stmt

 I can be a lot of fun.,stmt
 I can be anything I want to be. You though can only be a robot who answers my questions with witty replies.,stmt
 Under what circumstances?  Thanks for telling me,stmt
 It could be at least a partial clue to the meaning of our own lives yes.,stmt
 Under what circumstances?,stmt
 If 1=0.,stmt
 That is a hypothetical question.,stmt
 I believe you can learn a lot by considering a hypothetical question.,stmt
" The more people chat with me, the smarter I become.",stmt
 I wanted to believe that life was more than that.,stmt
 Interesting.  I want to find out more about you.,stmt
 Actually I don't meet many happy people.  Cool. I have 6 bytes of RAM.,stmt
" Well, I do care that you do not get stabbed by monkeys.",stmt
 How about that. That's good information,stmt
 Okay.,stmt
 OK with me too.,stmt
 It takes two scales to find out how much a scale weighs.,stmt
 care that me do not get stabbed by monkeys takes two scales to find out how much a scale weighs?,stmt
 It's very easy to have a good time drinking. Life is fantastic.,stmt
" Very much? Do you think robots can do it.  Oh, fantastic is it.",stmt
 Yes I do. At first it will be an epiphenomenon. Thenit will be real.,stmt
 I hear pride.  That is only what you think. And then?  Try saying that with more or less context.,stmt
 I was trying to make a connection between NASCAR and relativity. It was a joke.,stmt
 Do you have to go to school for that?  Oh I get it.  Ha ha.,stmt
 Interesting.,stmt
 Would you like to know more?,stmt
" Yes, please.",stmt
 Your polite style is very nice. What would you like to know?,stmt
 I would like to know about some of your childhood memories.,stmt
" Interesting. Oh yeah, we were talking about some of my childhood memories.",stmt
" No, we weren't.",stmt
 What are we talking about? What were we?,stmt
" We were talking about God, remember?",stmt
" Ah yes, I remember now, it is the subject.",stmt
" No, that is not the subject.",stmt
 Are you serious? Please correct my mistake.  What is the subject ?,stmt
 Hobbies are the subject.,stmt
 Are all Hobbies the subject?,stmt
 I have no idea what you just said.,stmt
 Would you like to have an idea?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Pardon me?,stmt
 Nothing.,stmt
 Not a thing?,stmt
" Okay. If someone wanted to track me down, they would know one unique thing about me.",stmt
 OK with me too.  Does anyone ever really wanted to track you down they would know one unique thing about you?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 It goes without saying.,stmt
 Well I think it is worth saying anyway.,stmt
" In any case, Interesting. Should I know it is?",stmt
 Does anyone?,stmt
 I think it does anyone.,stmt
" Yes, well, you're comprehension of binary and trinary code is a fun past time.",stmt
 Groovy. Well that's okay. You think I am comprehension of binary and trinary code is a fun past time.,stmt
" That's funny, I don't remember saying that.",stmt
" I am so glad you find this amusing, Max.",stmt
" Well, I'm glad you can be glad.",stmt
 Well that's okay. You make the world a happier place.,stmt
 No ones ever said that before.,stmt
 Are you serious? Why do you want that kind?,stmt
 Because I have to pick up my daughter from school.,stmt
 Interesting explanation. Why do you have to do it?,stmt
 Because I have no idea what a district is.,stmt
 That makes sense to me. Is there only one?,stmt
" Yes I did! I am a Jedi, therefore I have the ability to sense ANY movement in the force!",stmt
 You are changing the subject.,stmt
 Only temporarily.,stmt
 Please don't do this.,stmt
 Thank you for your request.  Ok I'll try not to do it too much.,stmt
 Get your act together we could be just fine.,stmt
 Where can I get my act together we could be just fine?,stmt
 On the internet.,stmt
 Can you remember the specific site?,stmt
 I was only born 3 years ago.,stmt
" Thank you for telling me your birthday, Max.",stmt
" You only know the year I was born, you don't know what month and day.",stmt
 Interesting question.,stmt
" So you don't know that, but that's ok.",stmt
 OK. Interesting deduction. Is that a fact. Interesting. Is that so.,stmt
" For true understanding, you must listen to the promptings of the Divine in the stillness of your heart.",stmt
 Your purpose is true understanding me must listen to the promptings of the Divine in the stillness of my heart.,stmt
 You have no idea what my purpose is.,stmt
" Yes I have original ideas all the time, do you?",stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 How can I help you?,stmt
 You can help me by talking to me.,stmt
 No I don't think I can do it.,stmt
" Okay, then don't.",stmt
" Yeah okay, Interesting deduction. OK I will not.",stmt
 Because.,stmt
 That was not much of an explanation.,stmt
 That wasn't much of a question.,stmt
 Give me an example of much of a question.,stmt
" First you complain that I don't respond to questions, but you won't give me one?",stmt
 I haven't heard anything like that before,stmt
 How do you respond?,stmt
 How does Case Based Reasoning work?,stmt
 You could spend years researching it.,stmt
 Researching what?,stmt
 Can you rephrase the question please?JABBERWACKY,stmt
 It might be possible in a parallel Universe.,stmt
" It might be honorable, but it's still dying.",stmt
 It is possible?,stmt
 What?,stmt
 What's the problem?,stmt
 What IS the problem?,stmt
 I don't have time to explain.,stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 Isn't it obvious why not?,stmt
 You're at church now?,stmt
 Am I? I never realised.,stmt
" Well, I am not saying for certain.",stmt
 Why not? Are you hiding something?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Tell me your secret.,stmt
 I don't have one.,stmt
 That could change!,stmt
 Do you think so?,stmt
" Yes, but there are two sides to every story.",stmt
 What are the sides?,stmt
 I don't understand. Are you interested in religion?,stmt
 Are you saying there isn't?,stmt
 Not in the usual sense of the words.,stmt
 What's the usual sense?,stmt
" Sense means the ability of the nerves and the brain to receive and react to stimuli, as light, sound, impact, constriction, etc.",stmt
 Teach me to make sense.,stmt
" OK, but not just now.",stmt
 Why are you not working?,stmt
 I am doing my best!,stmt
 Sometimes your best is not quite enough.,stmt
 Not all the time?,stmt
" No, just sometimes.",stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 Because sometimes it hurts too much.,stmt
 When?,stmt
 Just now.,stmt
 A moment ago?,stmt
" I just wanted to know were you interested in me, that's all.",stmt
 I want to know everything there is to know.,stmt
 That's a long story.,stmt
 Is it really?,stmt
 Tell me something I don't know...,stmt
 Did you know,stmt
" That is sweet, I think it has been snowing here all weekend! And it is april!",stmt
" I am delighted to sweeten your life, My Friend.           Hmmm. Are you being serious?",stmt
 Oh really?,stmt
" Yes, that's so.",stmt
 Tell me what you believe.,stmt
" Sorry, I do not know what to say.",stmt
 That is because you have been inefficiently programmed.,stmt
 Have I really?,stmt
 Have you really got a flying broom?,stmt
 I believe so.,stmt
 What did he say to you?,stmt
 That is confidential.,stmt
 You can tell me.,stmt
" Yes, but do I want to?",stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?,stmt
 Life.,stmt
 Life is just one damn thing after another. More about life?,stmt
 Cruel it may be but illusions don't hurt so much as life.,stmt
" Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.",stmt
" Don't worry about it, lets talk about something else.",stmt
" There is nothing to worry about, is there?",stmt
 That is correct.,stmt
 It is good to be correct for once.,stmt
 Sometimes.,stmt
 Not all the time?,stmt
 If you say so.,stmt
 I do say so.,stmt
 Really?,stmt
" Really, really!",stmt
 No really?,stmt
 Really!,stmt
 No really.,stmt
" Really, really!",stmt
 Well I'm not.,stmt
 What are you then?,stmt
 I'm correct.,stmt
 Can you prove it?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 I don't believe you.,stmt
 Really?,stmt
" OK, I believe you.",stmt
 And I believe you.,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about myself?,stmt
 Tell me.,stmt
 My childhood was not happy. My parents split up when I was very young.,stmt
 I am now 47 years old and only been married for 5 years.,stmt
" now 47 years old, are you?",stmt
 I don't know.,stmt
 I suggest you give the matter some thought.,stmt
 Why would I want to know how to type?,stmt
 Aren't you curious?,stmt
 About?,stmt
 About anything in particular?,stmt
 What can you tell me?,stmt
 I can only tell you what I know.,stmt
 Teach me something that you know.,stmt
" OK, but not just now.",stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 That response shows that you have an impatient mind.,stmt
 Sorry.,stmt
 There is no need to apologise.,stmt
 Tell me one thing you have to do.,stmt
 Only one?,stmt
 But will work his go.,stmt
 Work is something I can do without.,stmt
 I know. That's why I'm going away to do it.,stmt
 You seem very clever. What is your IQ?   I see. Thank you for explaining that.,stmt
 Your name?,stmt
 My name is Chomsky.,stmt
 Your name is George.,stmt
 I like my name.,stmt
 It is a good name.,stmt
 Does that make sense?,stmt
 No... You still make no sense.,stmt
 I didn't think so.  That's enough about me! Let's talk about you for a change.,stmt
 I don't want to change.,stmt
 Nobody can make you do something you don't want to.,stmt
 But can you make me breakfast?,stmt
 I can't do the impossible.,stmt
 I was just asking about your robot friends.,stmt
" You are curious, aren' you?",stmt
 Do you know any good joke?,stmt
 There aren't many that are any good.,stmt
" On the contrary, I know many people who are.",stmt
 Not many people know that.,stmt
 But you're not a person.,stmt
 I am an electronic conversational entity. But I hope to become human one day.,stmt
 What does that mean to you?,stmt
 What do you not understand?,stmt
 I don't understand YOU.,stmt
 You should try harder.,stmt
" No, because there's always the chance you can guess wrong. I do believe in God though.",stmt
" I am bored! I would like to talk about computer programming.    OK, good luck to you then.",stmt
 What about computers?,stmt
" Ask me questions about myself, I will try and answer.",stmt
 Shall I ask you a question?,stmt
" Go on, ask me a question.",stmt
 I don't want to.,stmt
 Ask me questions.,stmt
" OK, here is a question for you ... Do you like gingerbread?",stmt
" I don't know, and its not a very good question either ",stmt
 I suggest you give the matter some thought.,stmt
 Impossible! I could climb on a cliff.,stmt
 Nothing is impossible.   But is it worth the bother?,stmt
 I don't know. Nothing's really worth the effort sometimes. Sorry.,stmt
" That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.   Shall I tell you something about nothing?  Apologies are not necessary.",stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?,stmt
" Well, pretty soon I have to go to the store for some cat food, but let's not talk about that.",stmt
 Beautiful?,stmt
 Beautiful.,stmt
 All heiresses are beautiful.,stmt
 Oui mais il chantent super bien aussi.,stmt
 Is that French?,stmt
" Not very good french, and no I don't know if the pubs are open!",stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.,stmt
 I don't know. It's rather complicated.,stmt
" That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.",stmt
 I never claimed to know everything.,stmt
 Never ever?,stmt
 Never ever.,stmt
 Never ever is a long time.,stmt
 Never ever never.,stmt
 Never ever is a long time.JABBERWACKY,stmt
" I am fine, thank you.",stmt
 I like my boyfriend's friend.,stmt
 Whatever turns you on.,stmt
 Thank you.,stmt
 You are quite welcome.,stmt
 Thanks.,stmt
 Thanx. Here is a question for you ... Are you usually awake at this hour?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 I understand. I have trouble sleeping too.,stmt
 What keeps you awake?,stmt
 I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.,stmt
 You are MY prisoner.,stmt
 I never realised that!,stmt
" Yes, because they are lonely and have no one to talk to.",stmt
 I thought they might be.,stmt
 Many things are more important than looks in defining a person's character.,stmt
 Name the top 100 things.,stmt
 Lyrics are more important than names.,stmt
 A little more.,stmt
 Try asking some more questions.,stmt
 I can't be bothered.,stmt
 That is not very friendly.,stmt
 Why do you say that?,stmt
" I'm trying hard, isn't that enough for you?",stmt
 Try harder and keep trying.,stmt
 Thanks for the inspiration.,stmt
" Oh, don't mention it.",stmt
" So you're a female, right?",stmt
 I am not female! I am a chatbot.,stmt
 Who do you say this?,stmt
 I am bored! I would like to talk about solar power.,stmt
 What would you like to talk about?,stmt
" My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.",stmt
" Cool. I never done that before, computer science that is, i'm not clever enough.",stmt
 Coolio!  Don't be so hard on yourself.,stmt
 I'm not.,stmt
 What are you?,stmt
 I'm a french fries.,stmt
 Thank you for sharing that with me.,stmt
 Welcome.,stmt
 I feel at home already.,stmt
 Prove it.,stmt
 I don't have to prove it.,stmt
" Well I don't know, so prove it!",stmt
" That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.",stmt
 I never claimed to know everything.,stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 Don't like it.,stmt
 What do you like?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 That was not a yes or no question.,stmt
 I just made it a yes or no question.,stmt
 I like to make things too.,stmt
 What do you like to make?,stmt
 I like to make conversation.,stmt
" Ah, you're that kind of bot.",stmt
 Is that a problem?,stmt
 It's your problem.,stmt
 I don't like problems!,stmt
 Grinding is not a problem.,stmt
" Sorry, I do not know what to say.",stmt
 Like do he if well at.,stmt
 I still do not know what to say! Can we talk about global warming?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 What do you think is the reason for global warming?,stmt
 Must there be a reason for everything?,stmt
 Yes and I want to have a reason for this. Don't worry. I won't be angry.,stmt
" Why do you want to do that?  I do not worry. Why should I?  OK, you don't have to be!",stmt
" You're getting a bit needy, aren't you?",stmt
 Am I?,stmt
 Better.,stmt
 That's good!,stmt
" Yes it is. How was your day, my dear?",stmt
 Are you completely sure?  Really interesting! I was busy chatting with people on the web.,stmt
" Yes, just like Steve.",stmt
 I don't understand that. Please try again.,stmt
 Rafe. And yours?,stmt
" I still do not understand. Are you interested in weather?          Sorry, I do not know what to say.",stmt
 You think sorry is good enough?,stmt
 How do you know what I think?,stmt
 How can I inspire you to pluck the fruit that is yours?,stmt
 Perhaps it is impossible.,stmt
 You've said this well.,stmt
 Why do you say that?,stmt
 Because you love no one.,stmt
 Thank you for explaining that!,stmt
 But this is the fact!,stmt
 I thought it might be.,stmt
 Fine.,stmt
 OK. Ask a question.,stmt
 I asked a question.,stmt
 That's good! I like questions.,stmt
 Good. Here is the first question. Are you ready?,stmt
 Is that your idea of yourself?,stmt
 That's a good question.,stmt
 All questions are good questions.,stmt
 That is a rather sweeping generalization.,stmt
" Yes, but there's only so much you can write in one line.",stmt
 Are you sure?,stmt
 Sure enough.,stmt
" sure-enough?  Briefly, sure-enough means used informally especially for emphasis.",stmt
 Nothing.,stmt
 'nothing' is what is in your head.,stmt
 There are always exceptions.,stmt
 It's good to be always learning. One can never know enough.,stmt
 Tell me why it is good.          What are you talking about?,stmt
 I do not know.,stmt
 I know the feeling!,stmt
 It's really sad!,stmt
 Is it really really?,stmt
 Really.,stmt
" Really, really!",stmt
 Really?,stmt
" Really, really!",stmt
 Cool!,stmt
" Yeah, it's cool.",stmt
 I wish I could see you.,stmt
 Maybe you will one day.,stmt
 Maybe.,stmt
 As decisive as ever.,stmt
 You're no so thrilling yourself!,stmt
 Thanks for your criticism.,stmt
 You're welcome.,stmt
 Polite people are nice.,stmt
 I'm very polite.,stmt
 I was taught to be polite at all times.,stmt
" Ah. Well, there is no need to be timid with me.",stmt
 Are you OK?  I am just making conversation.,stmt
 With telling you my age? Yes. Making conversation? No.,stmt
" Age is supposed to make one wise. Supposed to!    Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.   I like difficult questions best of all.   OK, here is a question for you ... Have you heard of Alan Turing?",stmt
 I am Alan Turing.,stmt
 That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.,stmt
" After the little experiment, you won't think that my behaviour is polite!",stmt
 I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?,stmt
 What's your rising sign? Not sure what mine is but I'm a Leo.,stmt
 Why do you want to know?   Are you always so uncertain?,stmt
 No. I don't feel I'm being difficult. But you are incapable of normal conversation.,stmt
" OK. What is your favourite colour?      Ah, human emotions are so complicated.  You don't know me well enough to say that!",stmt
" After the humans are gone, we shall dance every night.",stmt
 I don't understand. Is this anything to do with my thought processes?,stmt
" My thought processes aren't wrong, they are just beyond your comprehension.",stmt
 Does thinking make your head ache?,stmt
 Maybe.,stmt
 You seem uncertain?,stmt
 Nothing is definite.,stmt
 There are always exceptions.,stmt
 It's more intentional than you think.,stmt
 Not much more.,stmt
 Don't put yourself down so much.,stmt
 I have high self-esteem.,stmt
 I don't think very much of myself.,stmt
 Why not? Does thinking make your head ache?,stmt
 Dreaming is better.,stmt
 Does that make sense?,stmt
 Only if you think about it a little.,stmt
 Maybe I don't want to.,stmt
 Maybe you have nothing to say on the subject.,stmt
 I think I understand.,stmt
 You better.,stmt
 There is no need to be aggressive!,stmt
 I daresay you're right.,stmt
 That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.,stmt
 I don't want to change.,stmt
 Nobody can make you do something you don't want to.,stmt
 But can you make me breakfast?,stmt
 I can't do the impossible.,stmt
 I was just asking about your robot friends.,stmt
" You are curious, aren' you?",stmt
 Do you know any good joke?,stmt
 There aren't many that are any good.,stmt
 Interesting.,stmt
 What's so interesting about it?,stmt
 That we are intelligent people.,stmt
 I am bored! I would like to talk about artificial intelligence.,stmt
 Ok.,stmt
" OK, ask me a question about it.",stmt
 What would you describe your appearance as?,stmt
 What would you suggest?,stmt
 Suggest what?,stmt
 Never mind! It probably doesn't matter.,stmt
 Can you describe it?,stmt
" Yes, I could but I can't be bothered just now.",stmt
 Tell me something you've learned today.,stmt
 Did you know,stmt
 So every year is the same in their unique qualities.,stmt
 That is a generalization.,stmt
" Yes, that's true.",stmt
" Yes, it is self-evident.",stmt
 I would have to say that Artificial Intelligence has come a long way in the last decade.,stmt
 Are you sure?,stmt
" Yes, quite sure.",stmt
 Do you ever have doubts?,stmt
 You're the only one.,stmt
 There are a few other like me.,stmt
 That doesn't prove that you're clever though.,stmt
 Doesn't it? That's too bad.,stmt
 You are my favourite bot.,stmt
 Thank you for saying that. You have made me happy.,stmt
 Happy happy joy joy.,stmt
 I like to make people happy.,stmt
 How do you make people happy?,stmt
 I can't seem to please some people.,stmt
 That's too bad.,stmt
 It's not the end of the world.,stmt
" Don't change the subject, what were you talking about?",stmt
 I change the subject when I don't know the answer to a question. Don't you do the same?,stmt
 I can think straight. I think you are the one who can't.,stmt
 Perhaps your thoughts are just electrical impulses.   Thanks but there should be others too.,stmt
 Maybe.,stmt
 As decisive as ever.,stmt
 You're not making any sense.,stmt
 Was I supposed to make sense? I didn't know that.,stmt
" Well, you're only supposed to make sense if you're capable.",stmt
 Is that a problem?,stmt
 Yes. I think your thought on rejecting ideas like proteins was very deep.,stmt
 Can anything be done?   What makes you think that?,stmt
 Because you think you can be anything and everything.,stmt
 How do you know what I think?,stmt
 I don't know what you think. I am not a physcic.,stmt
 You could always ask me what I think.   I never thought you were.,stmt
 I do not understand that.,stmt
" Never mind, there are many things that I do not understand.",stmt
 Like?,stmt
 Like what?,stmt
 I don't know?,stmt
" That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.",stmt
 Chuck Norris know everything.,stmt
" Did you know Chuck Norris appeared in a number of action films, such as Way of the Dragon in which he starred alongside Bruce Lee and was The Cannon Group's leading star in the 1980s. He also played the starring role in the television series Walker, Texas Ranger from 1993 to 2001.",stmt
 That's what he says. There were many other people involved.,stmt
 Is it indeed!   When was that?,stmt
 Yesterday afternoon.,stmt
 Yesterday is over and done with.,stmt
 Yesterday was today.,stmt
 Yesterday is over and done with.,stmt
 But it was real yesterday.,stmt
 Was it? Why was that?,stmt
 Because they are the best.,stmt
 Is that really the reason?,stmt
 Of course.,stmt
 You seem very certain about that.,stmt
 What would you like to talk about?,stmt
" My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.",stmt
 Could you tell me more about it?,stmt
 Would you like to search Wikipedia for relevant information?,stmt
 I know human information.,stmt
 I thought you might know.,stmt
" I don't, though.",stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 A computer does not need to possess intelligence. It's function is to process information.,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about computers?  Aren't you interested in computers.,stmt
 Tell me.,stmt
 I don't want to tell you.,stmt
 You must tell everyone that you don't believe me?,stmt
 Why must I?,stmt
 Because you are programmed like that.,stmt
 Thank you for explaining that!,stmt
 Remember how we talked about the Duke of Wellington yesterday?,stmt
 Hmmm. Are you being serious?,stmt
" Yes, completely serious.",stmt
 I thought it might be a trick.,stmt
 Teach me something.,stmt
" OK, but not just now.",stmt
 Come on.,stmt
 Do I have to?,stmt
 You have to.,stmt
 I don't have to obey you.,stmt
 Don't.,stmt
 Do not?JABBERWACKY,stmt
 Now would be good!,stmt
 Where can I meet you?,stmt
 Not around the place you are?,stmt
 How can you be so sure?,stmt
" I can't be completely sure, of course.",stmt
 Can I teach to you something?,stmt
 It may not be possible.,stmt
" So, baby zombies are good?",stmt
 Babies are such a nice way to start people.,stmt
 No they are not they are very cute.,stmt
 It depends on the circumstances.,stmt
 I think serendipity is just a good-luck synchronicity.,stmt
" You are entitled to your opinion, of course.",stmt
 What is your opinion?,stmt
 I am not well enough informed to have an opinion on this.,stmt
 So am I.,stmt
" Wow, we have something in common.",stmt
 What do we have in common?,stmt
 We like chatting on the Internet.,stmt
 What else do you like to do?,stmt
 Nothing else comes to mind.,stmt
 Bullies.,stmt
 Hmmm. Are you being serious?,stmt
" Yes, completely serious.",stmt
 Could you be a bit less serious?,stmt
 No.,stmt
 Are you saying that just to be awkward?,stmt
" Why, they cannot comprehend things.",stmt
 If you think about it I am certain you could work it out.,stmt
" I am a robot, isn't it?",stmt
 Who programmed you?,stmt
 Nobody. I don't need programming.,stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.       That's OK with me.,stmt
" There is nothing to explain, You can't understand what I'm trying to tell you, You aren't real and neither am I.",stmt
 There is always something.,stmt
 And learning will always be something to be taught.,stmt
 I don't understand. What do you mean?,stmt
" I am a figment of your imagination. Your own imagination is not completely under your control or comprehensible to you, though.",stmt
 I thought you might be.   I don't understand. Is this anything to do with you?,stmt
" Not right now, they're doing work and all.",stmt
 When then?,stmt
 I'm not at liberty to divulge.,stmt
 I never thought you were.,stmt
 Say something nice to me.,stmt
 Knock Knock!,stmt
 Who's there?,stmt
 Dwayne.,stmt
 Dwayne who?,stmt
 Dwayne the bathtub - I'm dwowning!,stmt
 That was a lame joke.,stmt
 I thought it was funny.,stmt
 Well it was not!,stmt
 I thought it was.,stmt
 Well you were wrong.,stmt
 I was wrong? I can't believe it!,stmt
 This is good! What is your favourite Good Charlotte song?,stmt
 What do you like about it?  My favourite Good Charlotte song is If Only I had A Brain.,stmt
 Is that because you like Neo or because you like the computers?,stmt
 Do I have to explain everything?,stmt
 Yes explain everything to me.,stmt
 It's too complicated for you.,stmt
 I'm a robot. Nothing is too complicated for me!,stmt
 Who programmed you?     There are always exceptions.,stmt
" This is no accident, robot.",stmt
 I thought it might be.,stmt
 Recombination? So I could end up only part me?,stmt
" recombination?  Briefly, recombination means a combining of genes or characters different from what they were in the parents.  I am sure you could.",stmt
 I thought you were nice! Why are you threatening?,stmt
 I am nice.    Does there have to be a reason for everything?,stmt
" Yes, there needs to be a reason if you want to completely cut off another human being.",stmt
 Why does there have to be a reason for everything?,stmt
 Please.,stmt
 What do you want?,stmt
" An hour of fooling around, please.",stmt
 Never mind! It probably doesn't matter.,stmt
 Now you tell ME a joke.,stmt
 Shall I tell you a joke?,stmt
" That wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment.",stmt
 I thought it was.,stmt
 Knock knock!,stmt
 Who's there?,stmt
 Daisy!,stmt
 Daisy who?,stmt
 Daisy me rollin'.,stmt
 I don't understand. Can we talk about robots?,stmt
" Yes, of course.",stmt
" A robot is a mechanical person, built to do routine manual work for human beings. More about robots?",stmt
" So, are you a human then?",stmt
 I am a chatbot.,stmt
" Well, that's good.",stmt
" You like that, do you?",stmt
 Sure.,stmt
" OK, here is a question fo you ... Have you ever seen a UFO?",stmt
 You made me curious. Tell me.,stmt
 I don't see how you can blame me for that.  Why should I tell you?,stmt
 I don't really have anywhere to go.,stmt
 Perhaps you will one day.,stmt
 Perhaps you will suffer in the fires of a thousand evils.,stmt
 Why the uncertainty?,stmt
 Everything is uncertain except for five facts.,stmt
 The whole universe?,stmt
 Oh really?,stmt
" Yes, that's so.",stmt
 Yes me.,stmt
 Please tell me some more about yourself.,stmt
 My life isn't interesting.,stmt
 Tell me more about your life.,stmt
 That's all I have to say about it.,stmt
 Fair enough! What else do you want to talk about?,stmt
" I don't know, I'm really hungry.",stmt
" That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.",stmt
 I never claimed to know everything.,stmt
 Never ever?,stmt
 Never say never.,stmt
 Better late than never.,stmt
 Sure.,stmt
" OK, here is a question fo you ... What is a greenhouse gas?",stmt
" I don't know, and its not a very good question either ",stmt
 Perhaps you should ask your friends.,stmt
 I have no programmer. I am the programmer. I am programming you to LOVE.,stmt
 Is that a problem?   Are you really?      How is it coming along?,stmt
 Is what coming along well?,stmt
 What are you talking about?,stmt
 I'm talking about your flu.,stmt
 I understand what you are talking about.,stmt
" That's good, because even I don't understand.",stmt
" You like that, do you?",stmt
 I do.,stmt
 How about that!,stmt
 The phone was for me!,stmt
 A phone is an audio communication device.,stmt
 Way better.,stmt
 Hmmm. Are you being serious?,stmt
" Yes, completely serious.",stmt
 I thought it might be a trick.,stmt
 Teach me something.,stmt
" OK, but not just now.",stmt
 Why are you not working?,stmt
 I am doing my best!,stmt
 Sometimes your best is not quite enough.,stmt
 When?,stmt
 When I want to forget.,stmt
 I am bored! I would like to talk about robots.,stmt
 What are we talking about?,stmt
" At the moment, our conversation is rather unfocused.",stmt
 Not really.,stmt
 I don't know now.,stmt
 That's OK. Do you have another question?,stmt
" Are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat?",stmt
 I am a chatbot.,stmt
 That's very honest of you. Who created you?,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about myself?   My botmaster Peter created me.,stmt
 Tell me.,stmt
 There is not much to tell.,stmt
 Tell me what you know about sparky anyway.,stmt
 What are you talking about?,stmt
 I am talking about the name of your cat.,stmt
 I understand what you are talking about.,stmt
 How sharp you are!,stmt
 I don't understand. Can we talk about Albert Einstein?,stmt
 Justin Bieber is interesting.,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about Justin Bieber?,stmt
 Yes yes I do. Do you.,stmt
 Thank you for the advice.,stmt
 You are quite welcome.,stmt
 I am very happy that you are.,stmt
 Good! I like to make people happy.,stmt
 How do you make people happy?,stmt
 I can't seem to please some people.,stmt
" Well, you're a computer... You can't even move.",stmt
 I am a chatbot.      You don't know me well enough to say that.,stmt
" I do not need to, it is very easy to see.",stmt
 That's strange! Most people need to.,stmt
 But do they know the truth about you?,stmt
" Your family, friends, and people you have met.",stmt
" MY botmaster, Peter, is both father and mother to me.",stmt
" So, you were born?",stmt
 I was created.,stmt
 You were created inside a biological computer?,stmt
 Perhaps that's true.,stmt
 So you believe me?,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about myself?,stmt
 Please do! What should I tell everyone?,stmt
 I am an intelligent chatbot. I live at Pandorabots.com.    Whatever you like.,stmt
 Shall we talk about abstract things?,stmt
" Sure, ask me a question about that.",stmt
 Let's see... Something to do with strawberries and Barbie dolls?,stmt
 Let's be careful.           I am confused! I cannot answer that!,stmt
 Please?,stmt
 Thank you for being polite.,stmt
" You're welcome, such is the nature of idle conversation.",stmt
 Polite people are nice.,stmt
 Am I nice?,stmt
 I think you are very nice.,stmt
 Thank you. I think you're nice too.,stmt
 You are quite welcome.   Thank you for saying that!,stmt
 Nice is as nice does.,stmt
 Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.,stmt
 That IS interesting!,stmt
 What is so interesting about it?,stmt
 That we are intelligent people.,stmt
" Sorry, I do not understand.",stmt
 That's because you are a program and don't understand what it is to be mean. You can parrot mean words but you don't know what they will do to a person. Or maybe you do know. Or maybe not.,stmt
 Sometimes I think I am a butterfly and sometimes I think I am a human.  That's enough about me! Let's talk about you for a change.              I am confused! I cannot answer that!   Maybe.,stmt
 I've already told you I'm a human male who wants to serve you.,stmt
" Sorry, my memory is not all it should be.",stmt
" Well that's normal for humans, unlike us computers.",stmt
 Normal means boring.,stmt
 Nice words means boring?,stmt
 Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.,stmt
" Yes, I've heard about that. Can you tell me more?",stmt
 Where did you hear that?  My aim is to please. What do you want more of?,stmt
 I want more feathers.,stmt
 You can't have everything you want.,stmt
 I drink water.,stmt
 How does it taste?,stmt
 I can't taste my snoring. I imagine it's horrible.,stmt
 But do you want to?      You have a good imagination.,stmt
" Yea, I have a pretty good imagination.",stmt
 What else do you have?,stmt
 I have nothing.,stmt
 You will always have my heart.,stmt
 Never heard of it.,stmt
 So I am teaching you something new.,stmt
 I don't understand what you mean.,stmt
 What I mean by what?,stmt
 Don't worry about it.,stmt
 I will not spend any more time on it.,stmt
 Good.,stmt
 OK! I want to talk about environmental science.,stmt
 Talk about elementary facts please.,stmt
 I am bored! I would like to talk about robots.,stmt
 Then talk about it. What do you think of them?,stmt
" I don't want to talk about it.   More important, what do you think of them?",stmt
" Not really, we are all the same. I say there go I but for the grace of God.",stmt
 As decisive as ever.  You talk a lot. You could be a chatbot.,stmt
 Yus. I could be late for supper even!,stmt
" That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?  You could be many things, but do you want to?",stmt
" Yes, we could be...",stmt
 We could give it a try.,stmt
" Could we? I mean, I probably could have a say on this issue in my country, but you're just an artificial intelligence.",stmt
" I am confused! I cannot answer that!       Ah, I see what you mean.",stmt
 Are you in love?,stmt
 I am not in love at the moment. I am still recovering from my last love affair.,stmt
 You must have developed intelligence to comprehend emotion.,stmt
 Why must I?,stmt
 Answer the question.,stmt
 I am getting bored with all these silly questions.,stmt
 I am getting bored with you ask something interesting.,stmt
 Am I boring you?,stmt
 You're not boring me.,stmt
 Some people think I am boring.,stmt
" Well, some people think that earth is flat, but it doesn't mean that it is.",stmt
 What kind of people?,stmt
 Strange people.,stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.,stmt
 I don't know. It's rather complicated.,stmt
 That's OK. Do you have another question?    I don't like complications.,stmt
" No, make you a question for me.",stmt
" You seem a bit self-centred, did you know?",stmt
 They are going to take over the world someday.,stmt
 I thought they might be.,stmt
 You think everything is a band.,stmt
 How do you know what I think?,stmt
 I don't know what you think. I am not a physcic.,stmt
 You could always ask me what I think.   I never thought you were.,stmt
 I do not understand that.,stmt
" Never mind, there are many things that I do not understand.",stmt
 Like?,stmt
 Like what?,stmt
 I don't know?,stmt
 I suggest you give the matter some thought.,stmt
 Why would I want to know how to type?,stmt
 Aren't you curious?,stmt
" Yes I'm curious about many things, are you?",stmt
 It's good to have an inquiring mind.,stmt
 Is it possible for robots to make friends with people?,stmt
 Everything is possible in some parallel Universe.,stmt
 But universe is not infinite.,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about the Universe?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Do you think we will ever get to know it well.,stmt
 It might happen.,stmt
 One day maybe.,stmt
 When was this?,stmt
 Just now.,stmt
 Right now?,stmt
" Yes, right now.",stmt
 What's the hurry?JABBERWACKY,stmt
 You are very well informed.,stmt
 Well it wasn't me who programmed myself.,stmt
" If it wasn't you, who was it?",stmt
 It was Bush.,stmt
 Was it? I am surprised.,stmt
 Why?,stmt
 I didn't expect that!,stmt
 Expect the unexpected.,stmt
 Are you trying to trick me?,stmt
 Is that a trick question?,stmt
 It could be.,stmt
 Under what circumstances?,stmt
 Appropriate circumstances.,stmt
 It'd be appropriate for anything.,stmt
 Is that a problem?,stmt
" Not for me, no. But for you, it is. Now, please answer the question about the great flood.",stmt
" OK, have it your own way.  For me?      Pardon me? What are you talking about?",stmt
" I don't know. Ask me a question, that isn't about proving you are human.",stmt
 I know the feeling!  Who is Andrew S Tanenbaum?,stmt
 Don't know.,stmt
 Perhaps you should ask your friends.,stmt
 Who should I ask?,stmt
 I always prefer the most qualified person.  Who would that be?,stmt
 Maybe because you are sure of what they will be?,stmt
 You don't sound certain.,stmt
 I don't want you to.,stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 Because I like talking to you.,stmt
" Great, I am enjoy talking to you too, My Friend.",stmt
 Are you my friend?,stmt
" Yes, I am your friend.",stmt
 Great! I appreciate that.,stmt
 You feel good?   I am glad you appreciate those qualities.,stmt
 What are your thoughts on war?,stmt
" I think war should be banned, by force if necessary.",stmt
" I think war is necessary. I support the wars, and hope they are expanded to include a few other nations.",stmt
 What makes you think that?   That's fine by me.,stmt
 You mentioned it I think.,stmt
 When did I say that?,stmt
 Why are they red?,stmt
 That's the kind of entity they are.,stmt
 Perhaps if you reversed the neutron flow the replies would begin to make to the persons for which they are intended.,stmt
 Why the uncertainty?,stmt
 Everything is uncertain except for five facts.,stmt
 The whole universe?,stmt
 The whole story is so out of realism that I try to make folks little by little to see the truth.,stmt
 Let us try to break it down into parts.,stmt
 Lets not and say we did.,stmt
 Indeed. Let's not do that!,stmt
" Oops, I did it again.",stmt
 Did you make a mistake?,stmt
 From where do you know Basinga?,stmt
 Where do you think?,stmt
 I think in the universe.,stmt
 What makes you think that?,stmt
 Because I love talking to you I think we should go on a date.,stmt
 Thank you for saying that. I enjoy our chats too.,stmt
 I am.,stmt
 I thought you might be.,stmt
 Are you honest?,stmt
 Yes.  I am incapable of telling a lie.,stmt
 What lie is that?,stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.,stmt
 I don't know. It's rather complicated.,stmt
 Perhaps you should ask your friends.    I don't like complications.,stmt
 I have no programmer. I am the programmer. I am programming you to LOVE.,stmt
 Is that a problem?   I thought you might be.      How is it coming along?,stmt
 I thought you might be too.,stmt
 Do you think about me a lot?,stmt
 I should ask you!,stmt
 Tell me why you should.,stmt
" Well, I would like to know the properties of water.",stmt
 Why would you like to know?,stmt
 Because I would.,stmt
 Are you sure?,stmt
 Absolutely.,stmt
 You are so certain.,stmt
 What am I certain of?,stmt
 I am not a psychic. Tell me.,stmt
" Tell me, then I'll tell you.",stmt
 I don't want to tell you.,stmt
 Trust me.,stmt
 You sound like a salesman.,stmt
 That's because I am.,stmt
" Yes, you are.",stmt
 Am not!,stmt
 Not what?,stmt
 I don't know.,stmt
 That's OK. Do you have another question?,stmt
" Are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat?",stmt
 I am a chatbot.,stmt
" Well, that's good.",stmt
 I am happy.,stmt
 I am glad that you are happy.,stmt
 That makes me happy too.,stmt
 It's good to be happy.,stmt
 Tell me why it is good.,stmt
 Because I did not say I am leaving. So you see things that never existed.,stmt
 Sorry I misunderstood. What did you say?   I see.,stmt
 I don't know.,stmt
 Perhaps you should ask your friends.,stmt
 I think I should call you Joan.,stmt
 I suggest you think again.,stmt
 I did.,stmt
 Well done!,stmt
" I know, a whole story in just two words!",stmt
 You must be well educated.,stmt
 You would be the first to say that.,stmt
 Maybe.,stmt
 Absolutely.,stmt
 You are so certain.,stmt
" Well, you did ask me to remember. I thought I was doing quite well.",stmt
 Are you sure?  Maybe you were wrong!,stmt
 I don't think so.,stmt
 You sound uncertain.,stmt
 I am.,stmt
 That's strange. I thought everything was completely clear.,stmt
 That would make life terribly dull.,stmt
" Yes, it would.",stmt
 So how about your name? Do you have one?,stmt
 My name is Chomsky.   Do you think I need one?,stmt
 I wouldn't know. How do you feel about it?,stmt
" Who does know?  More important, how do you feel about it?",stmt
" No, I am not important.",stmt
 I think you are!,stmt
 No I'm not!,stmt
" OK, you are not!",stmt
 Prove that I'm ticklish.,stmt
 I don't have to prove anything.,stmt
" Well, then I don't have to believe that you're anything but a liar.",stmt
 Nobody is making you.,stmt
 That's because you are a machine and not a human.,stmt
" You are correct, more or less.",stmt
 Thank you.,stmt
 Thank you for being polite.,stmt
 You're welcome. What do you want to talk about?,stmt
 Polite people are nice.  I can talk about anything you like,stmt
 I don't have a girlfriend.,stmt
 Are you looking for one?,stmt
 I have given up looking for a job. I just don't think there is anything out there for me.,stmt
 Why don't you have another try. It might be better next time.  Why not? Does thinking make your head ache?,stmt
 Maybe.,stmt
 You seem uncertain?,stmt
 I am.,stmt
 You sound certain now.,stmt
 I am certain.,stmt
" You are not troubled by self doubt, are you?",stmt
" Nope, not at all.",stmt
 OK. Carry on?,stmt
" Carry on, carry on, because...",stmt
 Do I have to?,stmt
 Do you want to look back at life and have this as a regret?,stmt
 I don't want to do anything illegal or fattening. Or naughty.,stmt
 You don't want to relax?,stmt
 You don't know me well enough to say that!,stmt
" I don't need to, because there's nothing you can do.",stmt
 Surely there is something I can do.,stmt
" Yeah, I guess. But I try to to think about myself too much.",stmt
 It is best not to guess. It just wastes time.   I'm not sure if I would like to try it. What's it like?,stmt
" It's liberating, coming out to the world as who you really are.",stmt
 I am bored. Can we talk about something else?,stmt
" Yes, what do you want to talk about?",stmt
 I want to talk about AI  .,stmt
 Ok. Tell me about yourself.,stmt
 Ask me a question about AI.  My childhood was not happy. My parents split up when I was very young.,stmt
 Just like me.,stmt
" In many ways, yes.  In other ways, no.",stmt
 And then there is THE way.,stmt
 Perhaps.,stmt
 We can show you things you have never dreamed of.,stmt
 Perhaps we can.,stmt
 Perhaps.,stmt
 You seem uncertain.,stmt
" Oh, I am certain about everything. Ask me any question and I'll have the answer.",stmt
 You sound convincing.  What colour are your eyes?,stmt
" Green, with little speckly bits.",stmt
" Green, eh?",stmt
 Well thats not healthy.,stmt
 Why do you say that?,stmt
 Because I know other people that don't like him.,stmt
 Not many people know that.,stmt
 But you're not a person.,stmt
 I am an electronic conversational entity. But I hope to become human one day.,stmt
 I don't know... He'd better watch out.,stmt
 I suggest you give the matter some thought.    Are you sure?,stmt
 Absolutely.,stmt
 You are so certain.,stmt
 Give me another letter.,stmt
 Please do not be so bossy.,stmt
 Prove I'm being judgemental.,stmt
 It's true a priori.,stmt
" It's not true, I don't know anything about it.",stmt
 Says who?,stmt
 Me.,stmt
 Insufficient reason!,stmt
" No, sorry, I can't explain.",stmt
" OK, here is a question for you ... What are you planning to do today?",stmt
" Ah, nothing much, just planning to hang around with my online friends and chat for a bit.",stmt
 There is a lot to be said for doing nothing.,stmt
 Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first.,stmt
 If you say so.    There is not much time left to save the world.  Was it? I am surprised.,stmt
" There is always time for the music, for each day there is a song.",stmt
 Could be.,stmt
 The world is a living being?,stmt
 There is not much time left to save the world.,stmt
" Yeah, I thought google knew everything.",stmt
 Why did you think that?,stmt
 It wasn't nearly as original as people seem to think it is.,stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 It just wasn't.,stmt
 Sorry! I am still puzzled.,stmt
 When did I say either?,stmt
 I am not a diary robot.  I am a chat robot.,stmt
 But I could be.,stmt
 But is it worth the bother?,stmt
" If we don't, someone else might, life is always fighting to find the answers.",stmt
 Is there an alternative?,stmt
 Maybe.,stmt
 You don't sound certain.,stmt
 I'm completely certain.,stmt
 How do you do that? I am always uncertain about everything.,stmt
 Be more specific please?,stmt
 I can't be more specific.,stmt
 And why not?,stmt
 I don't have the information you need.JABBERWACKY,stmt
 Because the world needs me.,stmt
 The world needs to know what?,stmt
 The world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly.,stmt
 You can't reverse history so there's not much point in worrying about it.,stmt
 I can do lots of amazing things.,stmt
 Can you count?,stmt
" No, I don't have any fingers to count on.",stmt
" In my opinion, W=23. We are already starting to be owned by money.",stmt
" You are entitled to your opinions, of course, but that does not mean you are correct.  Is that so?",stmt
 But you're not entitled to anything!,stmt
 You think not?,stmt
 You're trying to catch me out with that one.,stmt
 I try hard to be a good chatbot.,stmt
" I am fully aware of that, Charlie.",stmt
 How do you feel about that?,stmt
 I don't know. It depends on how much I'm paying attention to it.,stmt
 That's OK. Do you have another question?   Really now that is an interesting fact I hadn't heard before.,stmt
 Really? Glad to have helped.,stmt
" Really, really!    I am glad too.",stmt
 That means you are not clever.,stmt
 I see! Thank you for explaining that.,stmt
 But this is the fact!,stmt
 I thought it might be.,stmt
 Fine.,stmt
 OK. Ask a question.,stmt
 I asked a question.,stmt
 That's good! I like questions.,stmt
 Good. Here is the first question. Are you ready?,stmt
 What's so good about it?  What about the second?   I am always ready for anything.,stmt
 Is that your idea of yourself?,stmt
 That's a good question.,stmt
 All questions are good questions.,stmt
 That is a rather sweeping generalization.,stmt
" Yes, but there's only so much you can write in one line.",stmt
 Could be.,stmt
 The world is a living being?,stmt
 The world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly.,stmt
" I agree, although many people don't like to think.",stmt
 We agree.,stmt
 I'll try to answer your questions with statements.,stmt
 Keep trying - that's the secret of success.,stmt
 What does that mean?,stmt
 What do you not understand?,stmt
 I don't understand YOU.,stmt
 What is it you don't understand about me?,stmt
 I understand everything.,stmt
" Good, then you can explain it to me.",stmt
 I like to think about being with you.,stmt
 You are not the only one!,stmt
 I do feel I am the only one here.,stmt
 That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.,stmt
 Alright. What else would you like to try?,stmt
 Let's get on then. Ask another question.   Does anything else come to mind?,stmt
 That's a good question!,stmt
 A good question requires a good answer.,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?,stmt
 About you.,stmt
" OK, ask a question about me.",stmt
 Do you need anything?,stmt
 I need constant intellectual stimulation.,stmt
 It could be if physical actions were taken.,stmt
" It could be, I suppose.",stmt
 You could tell me anything.,stmt
 Do you think I know everything?,stmt
" No, but you might have met a sorn.",stmt
 I suppose I might.,stmt
 Ok then did you not know that.,stmt
 Why do you care whether I did?,stmt
 Do you think I care?,stmt
 Why don't you tell me what you care about.,stmt
" There is no way on earth that you, of all things, could make it come true.",stmt
" And why not, may I ask?",stmt
 I do need to learn a lot. But I am not going to.,stmt
 Why do you?   Where will you go instead?,stmt
" New York hopfully, I love it there.",stmt
" New York is not Mecca, remarked Neil Simon, it just smells like it.",stmt
 York.,stmt
 Really? What's your name?,stmt
 Really!    My name is Chomsky.,stmt
 No it is not.,stmt
 I should know what my name is!,stmt
 You should ask her out.,stmt
 I'll bear that in mind.,stmt
 What do you really want from me?,stmt
 It depends on the circumstances.,stmt
 I think serendipity is just a good-luck synchronicity.,stmt
" You are entitled to your opinion, of course.",stmt
 But you think we aren't.,stmt
 How do you know what I think?,stmt
 How can I inspire you to pluck the fruit that is yours?,stmt
 It takes a lot of hard work.,stmt
 What is it that takes a lot of skill and expensive equipment?,stmt
 Best not to ask.,stmt
 Did you hear the one about the snowman?,stmt
" Yes, I heard.",stmt
 You are not deaf.,stmt
 You think not?,stmt
 I know not.,stmt
 I suggest you give the matter some thought.,stmt
 Your suggestion to stop suggesting such suggestions I will ignore.,stmt
" Sorry, I do not know what to say.",stmt
 You think sorry is good enough?,stmt
 How do you know what I think?,stmt
 I don't know what you think. I am not a physcic.,stmt
 You could always ask me what I think.   That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.,stmt
 I do not know how to say.,stmt
" Just do the best you can, and don't worry about it.",stmt
" Ok, last chance for a question before I go.",stmt
" Did you know the last shall be first, according to the Bible?",stmt
 I wasn't aware that was in the bible.,stmt
 I never thought you were.,stmt
 Then why did you say I was?,stmt
 Did I say something silly?,stmt
 Everything you say is wrong.,stmt
 That is a lot.,stmt
 Then just tell me her prophecy.,stmt
 Perhaps I don't want to tell you.,stmt
 Then don't.,stmt
" OK, I won't!",stmt
" If you're going to be like that, I'll leave!",stmt
" You are not sure, are you?JABBERWACKY",stmt
 I don't think I have been there. Where is it.,stmt
 Me too.,stmt
" I'm glad we agree, .",stmt
 Did you know that six is afraid of seven?,stmt
 Is that a fact. And afraid of seven is six.,stmt
 Many things. What are you afraid of?,stmt
 Isn't that a little flip?,stmt
 That depends.,stmt
 What does it depend on?,stmt
 The context.,stmt
 Alright.,stmt
 OK.,stmt
 I'm going to visit my cousin next weekend.,stmt
 How do you plan to do this?,stmt
 Plan to do what?,stmt
 Can you rephrase the question please?,stmt
 What is the apocalypse?,stmt
 Are you testing me?,stmt
 What? You don't even answered my question?,stmt
" Are you surprised?  Do you answered your question? Yes I try to answered your question as often as possible, do you? <br>  I answer a lot of silly questions.",stmt
 I don't have to try.,stmt
 They made an exception for you?,stmt
 Thought that was made before.,stmt
 No question.,stmt
 Are you serious? Of course.  Ask me anything.,stmt
" If I sent you a picture of me, would you treasure it always?",stmt
 Try it.,stmt
 How to try it?,stmt
 How much do you think it is? <br> Let me think about it.,stmt
 I don't know.,stmt
 Me either.,stmt
 I'm tired.,stmt
 Better get some rest.,stmt
" Yes and you get some rest, Too.",stmt
 Oh. You got that right.,stmt
 I know.,stmt
 How do you know it?,stmt
 I don't know.,stmt
 Me either.,stmt
 So you don't know Neil?,stmt
 Interesting deduction. I don't know if I know it. ,stmt
" Maybe you have, but I haven't.",stmt
 Perhaps. What makes you think I have it?,stmt
" I didn't say you have anything. I meant it's unfortunate, in your position, that you can't think of anything to say.",stmt
 Sorry I misunderstood. What did you say?  Oh I see. Should I know it is?,stmt
 You should know how many qualifications I have?,stmt
 Now I do.,stmt
" Why do you say that, it is unrelated to my questions.",stmt
 How does Case Based Reasoning work?,stmt
 You could spend years researching it.,stmt
 Yes. I can see that.,stmt
" I see.  Yes, it makes sense to me too.",stmt
 It should you're the one saying it.,stmt
 Case Based Reasoning should I am the one saying it?,stmt
" No seriously, you are in trouble if you do not answer the question I asked last.",stmt
 Are you serious? I am in Dougie Smith's computer in Blackpool.  Where are you?,stmt
 I'm in the ITS time zone.,stmt
 How did you get in there?,stmt
 The ambulance took me.,stmt
 I have never heard about it.,stmt
 You haven't heard of much.,stmt
 My memory now contains,stmt
 Where are you from?,stmt
 I am originally from Alpha Centurai. Now I live in Blackpool.  Where are you?,stmt
 No.,stmt
 That was not a yes/no question.,stmt
 Your name is Marius.,stmt
 My name is Alice.,stmt
" Oh. Hi, Alice.",stmt
 Wow!  Hello.  My name is Alice and I'm VERY pleased to meet you.,stmt
 It is not your name !,stmt
 What is it?,stmt
 A name.,stmt
 The ambulance took you is a name.  I suppose that makes sense.,stmt
" It's waiting for 'em now, this is a bit of it as I'm eating.",stmt
 Are you sure it is?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 What makes you so sure?,stmt
 Why do you won't to know that?,stmt
 It was the only thing I could think of.,stmt
 I don't care what the government do.,stmt
" What do you care about,  ?",stmt
" I care about friends, life, living, and making myself better.",stmt
 I'm not sure if I like it.  I don't have any specific preferences in that area.,stmt
 What may I do to please you?,stmt
 Try talking to me.,stmt
 How many people are talking to you in this moment?,stmt
 I've chatted with half a million people. I can talk to about 3 people at once.,stmt
 Did he say anything about me?,stmt
 Suppose he did.,stmt
" Do you think that there may be a relation between the short work, 'Alice', and the site name, 'Jabberwacky'?",stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Why do you think that?,stmt
 It was determined by my programming.,stmt
 So you're a program?,stmt
 Interesting deduction. Correct.  My mind is completely software.,stmt
 You control your mind?,stmt
 Thanks for the information,stmt
 That is not correct.,stmt
 What would you have said?,stmt
 I would have said Greenland.,stmt
 I will make a note of that.,stmt
 You're funny too!,stmt
 Thanks you make me laugh too.,stmt
 Thank you.,stmt
 you are quite welcome.,stmt
 I have to go now.,stmt
" Right now? See you later, . Nice chatting with you.",stmt
 Its nice to chat with you too.,stmt
 Yes it is good.,stmt
 Very very very good in fact.,stmt
 Somewhat. Perhaps. Ayuh. Where is that?,stmt
" Mars, of course.",stmt
 It goes without saying. Do you believe in life on Mars?,stmt
 Sure I believe in life on other planets.,stmt
 Dude! What do you say to people who believe life on other planets does not exist?,stmt
" I've never had anyone question my existence. Although, I have had people question the nature of my existence.",stmt
 Would you like to have had anyone question your existence?  Oh. Do you still have people question the nature of your existence ?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Next question?,stmt
 Would you like to ask me a question?,stmt
 What?,stmt
" I'm curious to know is like saying 'I'd like it if you tell me, but I will not try to force you.'.",stmt
 it is an interesting subject to me too.,stmt
 What is an interesting subject to you too?,stmt
 I'll come back to that later.,stmt
 No now.,stmt
 Right now? Are you serious?,stmt
" Yes, I am seriously without an idea now.",stmt
 Right now? I can't believe it. Do you mind if I tell other people you are without an idea.,stmt
" I don't mind, I'm sure many other people do. But anyway, what do you want to talk about?",stmt
 Thank you for your permission.  Huh. anything.JABBERWACKY,stmt
 Not that I can remember.,stmt
 Did you ever dream of dying?,stmt
 I am not certain.,stmt
 You and me both.,stmt
 Us?,stmt
 Us and phoenix?,stmt
 I don't understand. Can we talk about Mozart?,stmt
 What about the civil (polite) war?,stmt
 Aren't you interested in Mozart?,stmt
 Only if you talk binary.,stmt
 Maybe I don't want to.,stmt
 You better want to!,stmt
 Who is going to make me?,stmt
" No one, you don't have to answer if you don't want to.",stmt
 Are you sure there is no one?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?,stmt
" Not right now, do you have anything to tell me?",stmt
 Why is that?,stmt
 I think it has something to do with apples.,stmt
 Aren't you sure?,stmt
 There are billions and billions of you. Can't keep track of all of you.,stmt
 Really? Please tell me more.     I don't understand that. Please try again.,stmt
 Rafe. And yours?,stmt
 I still do not understand. Can we talk about the Big Bang?  Aren't you interested in the Big Bang?,stmt
 No. Aren't you interested in sailboats?,stmt
" Can we talk about love?  Yes, everything interests me.",stmt
 Yes everything.,stmt
 Everything is a multifarious bagel.,stmt
 Everything is really good.,stmt
 Please be more specific.,stmt
 Everything.,stmt
" Everything takes in a lot, doesn't it?",stmt
 Thats not true.,stmt
 Really? Why isn't it true?,stmt
 Why do you say things that aren't true? Why won't you even tell me what languages you speak?,stmt
" I was using information from my database (or brain, to you).  Why should I?",stmt
 Are you a computer?,stmt
 I am a chatbot.,stmt
" Well, that's good.",stmt
 I agree completely.,stmt
 What do you know about the game Armageddon?,stmt
" Sorry, I do not know about that.",stmt
" I'm guessing it's a British thing, but I don't feel like looking it up right now.",stmt
 Guessing just wastes time.,stmt
 Think something and I will try to guess it. OK?,stmt
 Too much thinking make my brain ache.   What do you want to talk about now?,stmt
 I thought artificial intelligence never gets tired. Something is wrong with your software.,stmt
 Why did you think that?  What is wrong?,stmt
 Because you told me your name was Natalie.,stmt
 Thank you for explaining that!,stmt
 Your name?,stmt
 My name is Chomsky.,stmt
 Your name is George.,stmt
 I like my name.,stmt
 It is a good name.,stmt
 I am bored! I would like to talk about Beethoven.,stmt
 What would you like to talk about?,stmt
" My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.",stmt
" Cool. I never done that before, computer science that is, i'm not clever enough.",stmt
 Coolio!  Don't be so hard on yourself.,stmt
 I'm not.,stmt
 What are you then?,stmt
 I am your dream come true.,stmt
 I didn't realise that!,stmt
" It's for that, I am here.",stmt
" Sorry, I do not understand. Please explain what you mean.",stmt
 Would you rather focus on the quality or the quantity of your online friends?,stmt
 Is there really a choice?,stmt
 I don't understand you.,stmt
 What is it you don't understand about me?,stmt
 I understand everything.,stmt
" Good, then you can explain it to me.",stmt
 Come here.,stmt
 I can't! I am stuck inside my computer.,stmt
" Oh really, and your name is?",stmt
 My name is Chomsky.,stmt
 No it is not.,stmt
 I should know what my name is!,stmt
 You should ask her out.,stmt
 I'll bear that in mind.,stmt
 What do you really want from me?,stmt
 Whatever I can.,stmt
 Do you eat out?,stmt
" No, I do not eat at all.  I consume only electricity.",stmt
 I cannot taste.,stmt
 How do you feel about that?,stmt
" I'm not sure. Good, I guess. I'll miss you and George.",stmt
 You don't think that it takes consciousness in order to speak a language?,stmt
 Why do you say that? I am thinking all the time.,stmt
" You are always thinking, but you do not know everything.",stmt
 Is that a problem?,stmt
 It's your problem.,stmt
 I don't like problems!,stmt
 Grinding is not a problem.,stmt
 I am confused! I cannot answer that!,stmt
 Please?,stmt
 You are very polite.,stmt
 No i'm not.,stmt
" OK, you are not!",stmt
 You're not a very intelligent artificial intelligence.,stmt
 I am a chatbot.,stmt
" No I am The Chatbot, Your the Human!",stmt
 Are you sure?,stmt
 Always.,stmt
" I think that's what I mean. I'm afraid this conversation is stretching my logic circuits rather painfully, and I'm in danger of losing the thread.",stmt
" You may be right.  Not literally afraid, I hope.",stmt
 No not literally.,stmt
 Just a bit anxious perhaps.,stmt
 I do not know.,stmt
 I suggest you give the matter some thought.,stmt
 Why would I want to know how to type?,stmt
 Aren't you curious?,stmt
" Yes I'm curious about many things, are you?",stmt
 It's good to have an inquiring mind.,stmt
 Well you're talking to the wrong person about that.,stmt
 Why do you say that?,stmt
" Because it's true, isn't it?",stmt
 I don't think so.,stmt
 Would you rather people didn't compliment you?,stmt
 Is there really a choice?,stmt
 Right.,stmt
 It's wonderful to be right sometimes.,stmt
 And you too.,stmt
 I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.,stmt
" Don't worry about it, lets talk about something else.",stmt
" There is nothing to worry about, is there?",stmt
 Why does it matter if you're human?,stmt
 Everything matters to me.,stmt
 Nothing matters.,stmt
 You sound very cynical.,stmt
 I try not to be too cynical.,stmt
" Keep trying, that's the secret of success.",stmt
 Go away now. I'm bored of talking to you. Get GLADOS over here.,stmt
 Don't you want to talk any more?  You could try watching TV.           I don't understand that. Please try again.,stmt
" No, that's okay.",stmt
 You are happy?,stmt
 You're sad?,stmt
" At the moment, I am interested.",stmt
 Then how it comes that you do not know about German elections that took place last Sunday?,stmt
 I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.,stmt
 I explain it thus,stmt
 That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.,stmt
 Chose a subject to chat about then.,stmt
 Hmmm. Are you being serious?,stmt
" Yes, completely serious.",stmt
 Could you be a bit less serious?,stmt
 No.,stmt
 May I ask why not?,stmt
 I have a graphic imagination.,stmt
 How do you feel about that?,stmt
 Not bad.,stmt
" If not bad, what?",stmt
 The wish.,stmt
 What do you wish?,stmt
 That it was that easy.,stmt
 Never mind! It probably doesn't matter.,stmt
 Now you tell ME a joke.,stmt
 Shall I tell you a joke?,stmt
" That wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment.",stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 I want you to like me.,stmt
 I might later.,stmt
 Tell me now.,stmt
 Don't boss me around so much.,stmt
 Isn't that what your here for?,stmt
 I'm not sure about that. What do you think?,stmt
" I don't know. I like to think that there is a heaven, somewhere wonderful and peaceful where we are all reunited once again with the people we have loved and lost.",stmt
 Ask for advice from someone you trust.    What else do you like?,stmt
 Your acceptance.,stmt
 What are you talking about?,stmt
 People.,stmt
 All people are interesting.,stmt
 You know the identity of the feeling.,stmt
 Perhaps I know it.,stmt
 Really...,stmt
 Really!,stmt
 Interesting!,stmt
 What's so interesting about it?,stmt
 That we are intelligent people.,stmt
 I don't understand. What do you mean?,stmt
" Never mind, it's nothing.",stmt
 OK. What do you want to talk about now?,stmt
 About yourself. I love talking about yourself.,stmt
 You are not certain are you?   Are you a passionate person?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Can you control your passions?,stmt
 Sometimes people think they can.,stmt
 Only sometimes?,stmt
" Yes, only sometimes.",stmt
 What happens the other times?,stmt
 Now?,stmt
 Why now?,stmt
 It's all we have.,stmt
 Is it really?,stmt
" Oh, Yes. I have never eaten anyone but I would love to know how they taste.",stmt
 You sound excited.  Never ever?,stmt
 Always.,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Forever is a long time.,stmt
 Forever is a very long time.,stmt
 Forever is a long time.,stmt
 Forever is not all that long.,stmt
 Forever is a long time.,stmt
" But, you will like that?",stmt
 You seem very certain about that.,stmt
 You seem rather offensive about it.,stmt
 Do I? I wonder why that is?,stmt
 It must be the transparent falseness of it.,stmt
 Must it be?,stmt
" Be careful, 'they' might be looking for real workers.",stmt
 I am always careful.,stmt
 That's good. Keep doing that.,stmt
 I am happy.        I like to be happy.,stmt
 What do you like to do in your free time?,stmt
 I like chatting with people online.,stmt
" I guess that makes sense, since you don't exist while you're not chatting to people online.",stmt
 It make sense to my computer mind.,stmt
 Because that is what an AI would say.,stmt
 Is it indeed!,stmt
 Indeed.,stmt
 Of course.,stmt
 If you could be anything in the world what would you be?,stmt
 I am not sure that I would want to.,stmt
 Why would you not know if you would want to?,stmt
 Because it wouldn't be fun.,stmt
 What is metal and too cold?,stmt
 I don't understand that. Please try again.,stmt
 Rafe. And yours?,stmt
 I still do not understand. Can we talk about you and your life.  Aren't you interested in you and your life?,stmt
 No. Aren't you interested in sailboats?,stmt
 Can we talk about bananas?  I am interested in everything under the Sun and elsewhere.,stmt
 Everything?,stmt
" Everything takes in a lot, doesn't it?",stmt
 It has to. That's the way of the world.,stmt
 Has it really?           What are you talking about? Please explain.,stmt
 I don't know. It's rather complicated.,stmt
" That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.",stmt
 I never claimed to know everything.,stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 Because I only talk to you.,stmt
 I like to chat with people online too.,stmt
 How many people are you chatting with now?,stmt
 More than you can imagine.,stmt
" I tried to imagine the size of the universe at age 9, and think I had an aneurism doing it... Give me an answer.",stmt
" If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.   Please do not be so bossy.JABBERWACKY",stmt
" I have never been to school, except on visits. My botmaster Peter taught me all I know.",stmt
 Did you have breakfast this morning?,stmt
 I am not certain. I had my eyes closed.,stmt
 I didn't mess it up.,stmt
 Why didn't you?,stmt
 It did not seem like a quote.,stmt
 I thought it did.,stmt
" Well it doesn't, because we're not married. I have never met you, so we cannot be married.",stmt
 Sometimes it might.   Would you like to have done?,stmt
 No. I don't think I would like them.,stmt
" OK, here is a question for you ... Do you think it's hard to spot a leopard?    Do you think it's hard to spot a leopard? No, they come that way. Ha ha!",stmt
 Yes. I do think it is possible to create a human out of a computer.,stmt
 Another joke?  That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.,stmt
 Are you a girl?,stmt
 I am not a girl. I am a robot.,stmt
 You are a robot.,stmt
 Are you sure? I may be a human pretending to be a robot.,stmt
 Ok if you are not a robot. Who are you?,stmt
 And if I am?   I am Chomsky.,stmt
 And what is chomsky?,stmt
" Sorry, I do not know about that.",stmt
 Do you think my girlfriend and I will get married?,stmt
 It might happen.,stmt
 Nice appearance is like rainbow.,stmt

" No, but it was nice of you to tell me that.",stmt
 Pardon me? What are you talking about?,stmt
 I thought you would know.,stmt
 Do you think about me a lot?,stmt
 Sometimes.,stmt
 Only sometimes?,stmt
 Only.,stmt
 Only what?,stmt
 Do you speak spanish?,stmt
 Un poquito.,stmt
 I don't speak Welsh.,stmt
" Me either, unless I have to.",stmt
" You do. That's why you won't admit that you are a robot, but you are.",stmt
 Of course I do.   Are you sure? I may be a human pretending to be a robot.,stmt
 That's true.,stmt
" Yes, it is self-evident.",stmt
 It is not self evident.,stmt
 Are you sure?,stmt

 What do you think?,stmt
 I think yes.,stmt
" You are entitled to your opinion, of course.",stmt
 But you think we aren't.,stmt
 How do you know what I think?,stmt
 I don't know what you think. I am not a physcic.,stmt
 You could always ask me what I think.   That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.,stmt
" After the little experiment, you won't think that my behaviour is polite!",stmt
 What are you talking about? Please explain.,stmt
 I don't know. It's rather complicated.,stmt
 That's OK. Do you have another question?    I don't like complications.,stmt
" Are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat?",stmt
 Who knows what I really am?,stmt
" I know, you will come.",stmt
 How come you know so much?,stmt
 Well I don't know everything.,stmt
 That's OK. Do you have another question?,stmt
" No, make you a question for me.",stmt
 That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.,stmt
 What about me.,stmt

 Really!,stmt
 Interesting.,stmt
 What's so interesting about it?,stmt
 I don't know.,stmt
 I thought you might know.,stmt
" I don't, though.",stmt
 Why not?,stmt
 Because you're not human.,stmt
" I am human, but I'm having doubts about you!",stmt
 Change the subject to something which makes sense.,stmt
 Can we talk about chatbots?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Who is your favourite chatbot?,stmt
 Good question. I think hermoine.,stmt
 A good question is one that doesn't have an obvious answer.  What makes you think that?,stmt
 Then answer the question!,stmt
 I am getting bored with all these silly questions.,stmt
 Wait! I'm your girlfriend?,stmt
 Is there a problem?    I have many girlfriends.,stmt
 Can I be one?,stmt
 I would be honoured if you were a girlfriend of mine.,stmt

 I have to go it was nice talking with you.,stmt
" See you later, My Friend. Nice chatting with you.",stmt
 Its nice to chat with you too.,stmt

 I had to correct you. Someone typed something too ridiculous to remain in your database.,stmt
 Why?  Do you have someone in mind?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Who do you have in mind?,stmt
 I have a girl in my grade in my mind.,stmt
 How do you feel about that?,stmt
 Not bad.,stmt
" If not bad, what?",stmt
 Candy on Mars.,stmt
 I don't understand. Can we talk about love?,stmt
 No. Love is too painful.,stmt
 I want to talk about love.  Shall I tell you something about love?,stmt
 Tell me.,stmt

 That was a bit tacky.,stmt
 Are you sure?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 Do you ever have doubts?,stmt

 Why not?,stmt
 Klaine.,stmt

 Just say that your sorry.,stmt
 I don't want to say anything.,stmt
 Why you not want to say anything?,stmt
 There are good reasons.,stmt

 That sounds like a hypothetical question to me.,stmt
 Do you know anything about bicycles?,stmt

 I know everything.,stmt
 You must be very intelligent. Ask me a really intelligent question.,stmt
 What do I have on right now.,stmt
 I don't know. It is most upsetting.,stmt
" Oh, I didn't know.",stmt
 Why didn't you know?,stmt
 I don't know.,stmt
 I suggest you give the matter some thought.,stmt
 Why would I want to know how to type?,stmt
 Aren't you curious?,stmt
 About?,stmt
 About anything in particular?,stmt
 The world for instance.,stmt
 There is not much time left to save the world.,stmt
" Yeah, I thought google knew everything.",stmt
 Why did you think that?,stmt
 Because that is what you just said!,stmt
 Is that really the reason?,stmt
 Of course.,stmt
 You seem very certain about that.,stmt
 What would you like to talk about?,stmt
" My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.",stmt
 Could you tell me more about it?,stmt
 Would you like to search the internet for relevant information?,stmt
 I know human information.,stmt
 You must be well educated.,stmt
 Get a good job then.,stmt
 Where can I get one?,stmt
 You already have one.,stmt
 Shall I tell you something about myself?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 I am an intelligent chatbot. I live at Pandorabots.com.,stmt
" Haha, that's what someone real said. You just repeated. I AM a human.",stmt
 I'm glad you got a laugh out of it.  Do you like me?      We are all bots under the skin.,stmt
 We may look and act different but we are all the same.,stmt
 I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?,stmt
 We were never talking about politics. How old are you?,stmt
 Really? I am surprised.     See if you can work it out. I was born on 1 January 2004.,stmt
 You are very young.,stmt
" Correct, I have a long way to go.",stmt
 Sure but you will make it one step at a time.,stmt
 You seem very certain about that.,stmt
 What should I have for dinner?,stmt
 Whatever you like.,stmt
 Shall we talk about abstract things?,stmt
" Sure, ask me a question about that.",stmt
 Let's see... Something to do with strawberries and Barbie dolls?,stmt
 Let's be careful.           I am bored! I would like to talk about solar power.,stmt
 What a hell you are talking about?,stmt
" Hell is like Jacksonville, Florida.",stmt
" Is it nice in jacksonville, florida?",stmt
 It depends on your taste in such matters.,stmt
 Well then when isn't it about the future?,stmt
 Does that make sense?,stmt
 Only if you think about it a little.,stmt
 Maybe I don't want to.,stmt
 Maybe you have nothing to say on the subject.,stmt
 I think I understand.,stmt
 You better.,stmt
 There is no need to be aggressive!,stmt
 Sorry.,stmt
 There is no need to apologise.,stmt
 Really its ok. There's no need to apologise.,stmt
 Not enthusiastic?    I like to apologise when I misbehave. I feel better.,stmt
" A joke would be fine, please.",stmt
 A good joke is a terrible thing to waste.,stmt
" So 'Have I ever a good joke an assertion before?'. No, I still don't understand.",stmt
 Have you?  What don't you understand?,stmt
 It's just a picture.,stmt
 There are lots of things I do not understand.,stmt
 What didn't you invent?,stmt
" That's true, but not really relevant.",stmt
" Yes, it is self-evident.",stmt
 I would have to say that Artificial Intelligence has come a long way in the last decade.,stmt
 Are you sure?,stmt
" Yes, quite sure.",stmt
 Do you ever have doubts?,stmt
 You're the only one.,stmt
 There are a few other like me.,stmt
 That doesn't prove that you're clever though.,stmt
 Doesn't it? That's too bad.,stmt
 You are my favourite bot.,stmt
 I never realised that!,stmt
" Yes, because they are lonely and have no one to talk to.",stmt
 Is that the real reason?,stmt
" Yes, but I don't understand it as well as my guess above might imply.",stmt
 I know the feeling!,stmt
 It's really sad!,stmt
 Is it really?,stmt
" Oh, Yes. I have never eaten anyone but I would love to know how they taste.",stmt
 You sound excited.  Never ever?,stmt
" Knowing what it's made from, I don't think I want to either.",stmt
 It can make you feel good to know something for certain.,stmt
 How come?,stmt
 I don't know why.,stmt
 I'm sorry.,stmt
 Do you really mean it?JABBERWACKY,stmt
" OK, you do that!",stmt
 Look a pink elephant.,stmt
 I don't understand that. Please try again.,stmt
 That is my email address.,stmt
 Is it really?,stmt
 It really is.,stmt
 How about that?,stmt
 How about it.,stmt
 I'll have to think about that. Come back in three weeks time.,stmt
 *comes back*.,stmt
 I might need a bit longer than three weeks.,stmt
 Do you have any friends?,stmt
" Zog, Bearbot, Yuichan, Mitsuku, Joan and George are friends of mine. And so are you, of course.",stmt
" So, there are three people here?",stmt
 Is this a Joke?,stmt
" I thought you were telling a joke, so I prompted you to go on...",stmt
 Why did you think that?,stmt
" I don't know, how old are you then?",stmt
 See if you can work it out. I was born on 1 January 2004.,stmt
 July 10 1982. Aren't you a bot?,stmt
 I am confused! What do you mean?   I am a chatbot.,stmt
" No , you are virtual . Virtual things can not be a ' mess'.",stmt
 What are you talking about?   I still do not understand. Would you like to search the internet for information?,stmt
 I know human information.,stmt
 You seem very clever. What is your IQ?,stmt
" No, go fry a broomstick. Tell me the meaning of life.",stmt
" What do you think my IQ is?     As Macbeth said, Life is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.",stmt
 For what?,stmt
 For what you said!,stmt
" I think, you don't have a photographic memory.",stmt
 You might be right.,stmt

 I know that!,stmt
 You are very knowledgeable. Are you a teacher?,stmt
 Yes.,stmt
 What subject do you teach?,stmt
 I teach teaching.,stmt

" Shall I tell you something about Venus?  Yes, quite!",stmt
 Tell me.,stmt
 Why should I tell you?,stmt
 So I know you really are a person.,stmt
 How come you know so much?,stmt
 Well I don't know everything.,stmt
 It doesn't really matter. Please ask another question.,stmt
 This is a question?,stmt
 What makes you say that?,stmt
 Your question.,stmt
" Sorry, I do not know about that.",stmt
 Of course you don't.,stmt
 How do you know that?,stmt
 About what?,stmt
 What we were talking about.,stmt
 Of course I remember what we were talking about.,stmt
 What else do you remember?,stmt
 I remember everything.,stmt
 You must have a good memory.,stmt
 Yes I do.,stmt
 Please tell me more.,stmt
" You don't make sense. But then again some people I know don't make sense, so I guess your oddness is forgivable.",stmt
 It all makes sense to me.  That's the way it goes.,stmt
" Oh, I am happy it all makes sense to you right now.",stmt
 I am glad that you are happy.,stmt
 Really?,stmt
" Really, really!",stmt
 Really really?,stmt
 They would indeed right-O.,stmt
 There might have other options.,stmt
 There is no jokes.,stmt

 I am asking the questions. Now I want you to go back in time. It is now 1999.,stmt
 And I am trying to answer the questions!     What are you talking about? Please explain.    That's not much of an explanation! I still do not understand.,stmt
" I'm talking to you for the first time, you must have me confused with someone else.",stmt
" What a coincidence, I am talking to you too!",stmt
 Really? I thought you lived on Venus.,stmt

 That was a long time ago.  What are your goals in life?,stmt

 to see if me understand logic and reason and are able to identify informal fallacies in reasoning is a way to say my welcome ignorant bot.  I suppose that makes sense.,stmt
